## Our Mission

Predifi is building the **future of prediction markets**—a place where anyone can trade on their knowledge and beliefs about real-world events.

We believe that prediction markets are powerful tools for:
- **Price Discovery** - Aggregating collective intelligence to forecast outcomes
- **Information Markets** - Creating economic incentives for truth-seeking
- **Financial Inclusion** - Democratizing access to sophisticated trading tools
- **Decentralized Governance** - Enabling community-driven decision-making

Our mission is to make prediction market trading **accessible, efficient, and rewarding** for everyone—from casual traders to institutional participants.

## What We're Building

### A Unified Trading Experience

Traditional prediction markets are fragmented. Users have to create accounts on multiple platforms, manage different wallets, and navigate inconsistent interfaces. This creates friction and limits liquidity.

**Predifi solves this** by aggregating multiple prediction market venues into one seamless interface. Trade on Polymarket, Limitless, and Predifi's native markets—all from a single platform with unified liquidity.

## Why Blockchain?

Predifi is built on blockchain technology because prediction markets need:

### 🔒 **Trustlessness**
No central authority controls outcomes or holds your funds. Smart contracts enforce rules automatically.

### 🌐 **Permissionless Access**
Anyone with a wallet can trade. No KYC, no geographic restrictions, no account approvals.

### 💎 **Transparency**
All trades, settlements, and market resolutions happen on-chain. Anyone can verify.

### 🔓 **Self-Custody**
You maintain complete control of your assets. Trade directly from your wallet without deposits.

### ⚡ **Programmability**
Smart contracts enable complex features like cross-chain trading, automated market making, and instant settlement.
