## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Small" icon="seedling">
    Begin with a small deposit ($100-500) to understand how vaults work before committing significant capital.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Diversify Across Vaults" icon="chart-scatter">
    Don't put all capital in one vault. Spread across 2-3 different strategies to reduce risk.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Regularly" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Check vault performance weekly. If APY drops significantly or risk increases, consider rebalancing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compound Earnings" icon="rotate">
    Let earnings compound by leaving them in the vault instead of withdrawing frequently.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understand the Risks" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Read [Returns and Risks](/liquidity/returns-and-risks) to fully understand what you're signing up for.

## Troubleshooting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Transaction Failing">
    **Common causes:**
    - Insufficient USDC balance
    - Insufficient gas (need ETH/MATIC/BNB for gas)
    - Below minimum deposit ($100)
    - Network congestion (increase gas)
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify USDC balance
    - Add gas token to wallet
    - Wait 10 min and retry
    - Increase gas price
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not Receiving Vault Tokens">
    **Check:**
    - Transaction confirmed on blockchain explorer
    - Correct wallet connected
    - Vault token added to wallet
    - Refresh Predifi app
    
    If still missing after 5 minutes, contact support with transaction hash.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Can't Withdraw">
    **Possible reasons:**
    - Vault at high utilization (join queue)
    - Pending withdrawal already in queue
    - Network congestion
    - Insufficient gas
    
    **Try:**
    - Request queued withdrawal
    - Wait for vault rebalancing
    - Increase gas price
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="APY Seems Wrong">
    **Remember:**
    - APY is annualized from last 7 days
    - APY fluctuates based on trading volume
    - Shown APY is gross (before your specific entry/exit)
    - Your actual return may differ
    
    Check vault details page for methodology.

## Advanced: Direct Smart Contract Interaction

For advanced users, interact directly with vault contracts:

```solidity
// ERC-4626 standard methods
vault.deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
vault.withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
vault.redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)

// View functions
vault.totalAssets() // Total USDC in vault
vault.convertToAssets(shares) // Your USDC value
vault.previewDeposit(assets) // Shares you'd receive
```
