## Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with $100-500 to understand vaults before committing more.
- **Diversify**: Spread across 2-3 different vault strategies to reduce risk.
- **Monitor Regularly**: Check performance weekly. Rebalance if APY drops or risk increases.
- **Compound Earnings**: Let earnings compound by leaving them in vault.
- **Understand Risks**: Read [Returns and Risks](/liquidity/returns-and-risks) carefully.

## Troubleshooting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Transaction Failing">
    **Causes:** Insufficient USDC, insufficient gas, below $100 minimum, network congestion
    
    **Solutions:** Verify USDC balance, add gas token, wait 10 min and retry, increase gas price
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not Receiving Vault Tokens">
    **Check:** Transaction confirmed, correct wallet, vault token added to wallet, refresh app
    
    If missing after 5 min, contact support with transaction hash.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Can't Withdraw">
    **Reasons:** High utilization (join queue), pending withdrawal in queue, network congestion, insufficient gas
    
    **Try:** Request queued withdrawal, wait for rebalancing, increase gas
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="APY Seems Wrong">
    **Remember:** APY annualized from last 7 days, fluctuates with volume, gross (before your entry/exit), your actual return may differ
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
