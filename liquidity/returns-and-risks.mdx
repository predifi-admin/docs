## Understanding LP Returns

LPs earn **8-15% APY** on average, but returns vary based on market conditions, trading volume, and vault strategy.

## Sources of Returns

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trading Fees" icon="coins">
    **Primary income**: 60% of all trading fees, earned on every trade, compounds automatically, scales with volume
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Spread Capture" icon="chart-line">
    **Market making**: Bid-ask spread profits, price improvement, rebalancing gains, arbitrage opportunities
  </Card>

## Return Scenarios

### Best Case (20-30% APY)

**When:** High volume (elections, major events), volatile markets, efficient strategy. **Example:** Presidential election week—massive volume generates 25% APY.

### Average Case (10-15% APY)

**When:** Normal conditions, steady activity, balanced wins/losses. **Example:** Typical month with mix of sports, crypto, political markets.

### Worst Case (0-5% APY or negative)

**When:** Low volume (off-season), informed traders win consistently, major adverse outcomes. **Example:** Slow summer with few events, vault loses on several positions.

## Risk Management Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Diversify Vaults">
    Split capital: 40% Universal (diversified), 30% Crypto (higher APY), 30% Sports (seasonal)
    
    **Benefit:** Reduce correlation, smooth returns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Dollar-Cost Average">
    Add gradually: Start 25%, add 25% monthly over 4 months
    
    **Benefit:** Avoid entering at peak
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Set Stop-Loss">
    Define exits: -10% from peak = withdraw 50%, -20% = exit completely
    
    **Benefit:** Protect against drawdowns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Monitor Performance">
    Review weekly: APY trending? Win rate? Strategy changes? Better alternatives?
    
    **Benefit:** Data-driven decisions
  </Tab>

## When to Provide Liquidity

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ Good Times" icon="check">
    High volume expected, new vault incentives, APY above average, low utilization, bullish on prediction markets
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="❌ Bad Times" icon="xmark">
    Low volume (off-season), underperforming 2-3 months, high smart money activity, better opportunities elsewhere, need immediate liquidity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparing to Other Yield Sources

| Yield Source | APY | Risk | Liquidity | IL Risk |
|--------------|-----|------|-----------|---------|
| **Predifi LP** | 8-15% | Medium | Hours-days | Yes (outcome) |
| **Aave USDC** | 2-4% | Low | Instant | No |
| **Uniswap V3** | 10-30% | High | Instant | Yes (price) |
| **Polymarket LP** | 5-12% | Medium | Instant | Yes (outcome) |
| **Stablecoin Farming** | 5-10% | Low-Med | Days | No |

**Key:** Predifi LP risk is **outcome-based** (event results), not price-based (like Uniswap). Higher than lending, lower than volatile DEX LPing.

## Best Practices for LPs

- **Understand Investment**: Read vault docs, review performance, understand markets, know risks.
- **Start Small**: Begin $100-500, monitor 30 days, increase if meeting expectations, cap at 5-10% net worth.
- **Diversify**: Use 2-3 vault strategies, split across chains, maintain portfolio diversification.
- **Monitor Regularly**: Check weekly, review APY trends monthly, adjust quarterly, stay informed.
- **Have Exit Plan**: Define return thresholds, set stop-loss rules, know withdrawal process, don't panic on temporary drawdowns.
