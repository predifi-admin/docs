## Understanding LP Returns

Liquidity providers earn **8-15% APY** on average, but returns vary based on market conditions, trading volume, and vault strategy.

## Return Scenarios

### Best Case (20-30% APY)

**When:**
- High trading volume (election season, major events)
- Volatile markets with frequent repricing
- Efficient vault strategy capturing spreads

**Example:** Presidential election week—massive trading volume generates 25% APY.

### Average Case (10-15% APY)

**When:**
- Normal market conditions
- Steady trading activity across multiple markets
- Balanced wins and losses on outcomes

**Example:** Typical month with mix of sports, crypto, and political markets.

### Worst Case (0-5% APY or negative)

**When:**
- Low trading volume (off-season)
- Informed traders consistently beat vault positioning
- Major adverse outcomes

**Example:** Slow summer month with few major events, vault loses on several large positions.

## Risk Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Outcome Risk (Medium)" icon="dice">
    **Risk:** Vault liquidity is on wrong side of market outcomes
    
    **Impact:** Can lead to 2-5% monthly losses during bad streaks
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Automated rebalancing to neutral positions
    - Diversification across 100+ markets
    - Dynamic hedging strategies
    - Max 5% exposure per market
    
    **Your Protection:** Vaults aim for market-neutral positioning
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="2. Smart Money Risk (Medium-High)" icon="brain">
    **Risk:** Informed traders with edge betting against LP liquidity
    
    **Impact:** LPs can lose 5-10% if consistently providing liquidity to sharp traders
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Machine learning models detect informed flow
    - Dynamic spreads widen when smart money identified
    - Reduced liquidity provision to suspicious markets

    - Withdrawal queue system ensures fairness
    - Markets resolve regularly, freeing capital
    - Emergency withdrawal mechanism for urgent needs
    
    **Your Protection:** Most withdrawals are instant; queues rare and short
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="5. Oracle Risk (Low)" icon="tower-broadcast">
    **Risk:** Incorrect market resolution due to oracle failure
    
    **Impact:** Vault could be on losing side of incorrect resolution

| Month | APY | Total Fees | Win Rate | Utilization |
|-------|-----|------------|----------|-------------|
| Jan 2025 | 14.2% | $12,450 | 58% | 72% |

## Comparing Risk vs. Return

| Strategy | Expected APY | Risk Level | Best For |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | 6-8% | Low | Risk-averse LPs, steady income |
| **Moderate** | 10-15% | Medium | Balanced approach, most LPs |
| **Aggressive** | 15-25% | High | Risk-tolerant, high conviction |

## Fee Breakdown

**Example:** $10,000 deposited in Universal Vault

### Monthly Earnings (12% APY)

```
Total Trading Volume: $5,000,000/month
Average Trading Fee: 0.5%
Total Fees Generated: $25,000

LP Share (60%): $15,000
Your Vault Share (e.g., 1% of vault): $150/month
Annualized: $1,800/year = 18% APY on $10,000

After accounting for losses on outcomes:
Net APY: 12% = $1,200/year = $100/month
```

## Comparing to Other Yield Sources

| Yield Source | APY | Risk | Liquidity | IL Risk |
|--------------|-----|------|-----------|---------|
| **Predifi LP Vaults** | 8-15% | Medium | Hours to days | Yes (outcome risk) |
| **Aave USDC Lending** | 2-4% | Low | Instant | No |
| **Uniswap V3 LP** | 10-30% | High | Instant | Yes (price divergence) |
| **Polymarket LP** | 5-12% | Medium | Instant | Yes (outcome risk) |
| **Stablecoin Farming** | 5-10% | Low-Medium | Days | No |

**Key Differences:**
