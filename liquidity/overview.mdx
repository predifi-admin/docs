## Become a Liquidity Provider

Liquidity Providers (LPs) earn yield from trading fees while helping traders access deep liquidity across prediction markets.

<Tip>

## What You Earn

### Fee Structure

**60% of trading fees go to LPs**

When traders use your vault's liquidity:
- **CLOB trades:** 0.5% fee → **0.3% to LPs**
- **Aggregated trades:** 0.3% fee → **0.18% to LPs**

Fees accrue continuously and compound automatically.
