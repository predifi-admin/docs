## Risk Factors

### Understanding LP Risk

<Warning>
**Key Risk:** LPs can lose money if markets are mispriced or if traders consistently win against the liquidity pool.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Impermanent Loss" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    **What it is:** Opportunity cost of providing liquidity vs. holding USDC
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Markets resolve against LP position
    - Traders identify mispriced markets
    - LP vault bets wrong side of outcomes
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Diversification across many markets
    - Automated risk management
    - Balanced positioning on both sides
    
    **Example:**
    - Vault provides liquidity to BTC > $100K market
    - Vault holds 50/50 YES/NO position
    - BTC hits $105K: YES wins, vault breaks even on outcome
    - But vault earned 0.3% fees from all trades → Net profit
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Smart Money Risk" icon="brain">
    **What it is:** Skilled traders with information advantage
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Informed traders bet against LP liquidity
    - LPs provide liquidity to mispriced markets
    - Adverse selection (smart money wins, LPs lose)
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Predifi's automated pricing adjusts to informed flow
    - Dynamic spreads widen when informed trading detected
    - Machine learning models identify smart money
    
    **Protection:** Vaults use Predifi's risk engine to avoid toxic flow
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Market Resolution Risk" icon="gavel">
    **What it is:** Risk of incorrect oracle resolution or disputes
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Oracle provides wrong outcome data
    - Ambiguous market resolution criteria
    - Delayed settlements due to disputes
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Multiple oracle providers (Stork Network)
    - Clear market resolution criteria
    - Dispute resolution mechanisms
    - Insurance fund for oracle failures (coming soon)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Smart Contract Risk" icon="file-code">
    **What it is:** Risk of bugs or exploits in vault contracts
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Undiscovered vulnerabilities
    - Flash loan attacks
    - Protocol exploits
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - **90%+ test coverage** on all contracts
    - **Multiple audits** by top firms
    - **Bug bounty program** ($100K+)
    - **Time-locked upgrades** (48-hour delay)
    - **Insurance fund** for contract failures
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Liquidity Risk" icon="droplet">
    **What it is:** Inability to withdraw due to locked capital
    
    **When it happens:**
    - All vault capital deployed to open markets
    - Markets haven't resolved yet
    - High utilization of vault
    
    **Mitigation:**
    - Vaults maintain 10-20% liquidity buffer
    - Markets resolve within days/weeks
    - Emergency withdrawal queue system
    
    **Typical withdrawal time:** Instant to 7 days (depending on vault utilization)

    - Prioritize high-volume markets
    - Allocate more to profitable markets
    - Reduce exposure to losing markets
    - Machine learning optimization
    
    **Goal:** Maximize fee income per dollar deployed
