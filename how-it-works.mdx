## What Are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets (also called "information markets" or "event markets") let you trade on the outcome of future events.

### The Concept

Instead of betting against a bookmaker, you trade shares with other users. Each share represents a claim on a specific outcome:

- **YES shares** pay $1 if the event happens
- **NO shares** pay $1 if the event doesn't happen

The **current price** reflects the market's collective belief about the probability of that outcome.

<Note>
  **Example**: If a YES share for "Will Bitcoin hit $100k in 2025?" trades at $0.65, the market estimates a 65% probability.
</Note>

### Why They're Powerful

Prediction markets have proven to be remarkably accurate because:

1. **Financial Incentives** - Traders profit from being correct, creating strong motivation for accuracy
2. **Collective Intelligence** - Markets aggregate information from many participants
3. **Price Discovery** - Continuous trading reveals real-time probability estimates
4. **Self-Correcting** - Mispriced markets create arbitrage opportunities that push prices toward truth

## How Trading Works

### Basic Trading Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Market">
    Browse markets on politics, sports, crypto, entertainment, or other categories. Each market has a binary outcome (YES/NO).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analyze the Odds">
    Review current prices, volume, liquidity, and historical charts. Consider whether the market is correctly priced.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take a Position">
    If you think YES is underpriced, buy YES shares. If you think NO is underpriced, buy NO shares.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Hold or Exit">
    Hold your position until the market resolves, or sell early to lock in profits or cut losses.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement">
    When the event resolves, winning shares pay out $1.00 per share. Losing shares expire worthless.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Prices

Prices in prediction markets represent **implied probability**:

| Price | Implied Probability | Meaning |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| $0.90 | 90% | Market thinks outcome is very likely |
| $0.65 | 65% | Market thinks outcome is somewhat likely |
| $0.50 | 50% | Market is uncertain (50/50) |
| $0.35 | 35% | Market thinks outcome is somewhat unlikely |
| $0.10 | 10% | Market thinks outcome is very unlikely |

<Tip>
  **Trading Strategy**: If you believe the true probability is higher than the market price, buy YES. If you think it's lower, buy NO.
</Tip>

### Profit Examples

#### Example 1: Simple YES Trade
- You buy 100 YES shares at $0.60 each = **$60 invested**
- Event resolves YES
- You receive 100 × $1.00 = **$100 payout**
- **Profit: $40** (67% return)

#### Example 2: Early Exit
- You buy 50 YES shares at $0.45 each = **$22.50 invested**
- Price moves to $0.75 before resolution
- You sell at $0.75 = **$37.50 received**
- **Profit: $15** (67% return without waiting for resolution)

#### Example 3: NO Trade
- You buy 200 NO shares at $0.30 each = **$60 invested**
- Event resolves NO
- You receive 200 × $1.00 = **$200 payout**
- **Profit: $140** (233% return)

## How Predifi Enhances Trading

### 1. Aggregated Liquidity

Traditional prediction markets suffer from **fragmented liquidity**. A market on Polymarket might have great liquidity while the same market on another venue is illiquid.

**Predifi's Aggregator** pools liquidity from multiple sources, giving you:
- ✅ Better prices (tighter spreads)
- ✅ Larger trade sizes without slippage
- ✅ More market options
- ✅ Unified portfolio management

### 2. Professional Trading Interface

**Predifi's Native CLOB** provides a professional trading experience:
- 📊 Full orderbook depth (Level 2 data)
- 📈 Real-time charts and price history
- 🎯 Limit orders and market orders
- ⚡ Instant order matching
- 💼 Portfolio analytics and P&L tracking

### 3. Cross-Chain Trading

Markets exist on different blockchains (Polygon for Polymarket, Base for Limitless, etc.). Predifi handles the complexity:
- Bridge your funds automatically
- Trade across chains from one interface
- Settle back to your preferred chain
- No manual bridging required

### 4. Best Execution

When you place a trade, Predifi's routing engine:
1. Scans all available venues
2. Compares prices including fees
3. Routes to the best execution venue
4. Handles all technical details

You get the best price automatically without checking multiple platforms.

## Market Resolution

### How Markets Resolve

When the event concludes, markets must be **resolved** to determine winners:

1. **Outcome Determination** - The real-world outcome is observed
2. **Oracle Verification** - Decentralized oracles provide on-chain proof
3. **Smart Contract Settlement** - Winners can claim their payouts
4. **Payout Distribution** - $1.00 per winning share sent to claimants

### Oracle System

Predifi uses the **Stork Network** for tamper-proof market resolution:
- ✅ Decentralized oracle network
- ✅ Multiple data sources
- ✅ Cryptographic proof of outcomes
- ✅ Dispute resolution mechanism

<Warning>
  Markets only resolve when there's verifiable proof of the outcome. This ensures fairness and prevents manipulation.
</Warning>

### Claiming Winnings

After a market resolves in your favor:

1. Navigate to your **Positions** page
2. Find the resolved market
3. Click **Claim Winnings**
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. Receive USDC directly to your wallet

Claiming is instant and requires only a small gas fee.

## Risk Management

### Understanding Risk

Prediction market trading involves risk:

- **Market Risk** - Your prediction may be wrong
- **Liquidity Risk** - You may not be able to exit at desired prices
- **Event Risk** - Unexpected developments can move markets
- **Smart Contract Risk** - Technical vulnerabilities (mitigated through audits)
