## Aggregator Fees (Detailed)

### Protocol Fee: 0.05% - 0.1%

**What it covers:**
- Access to multiple venue liquidity
- Smart order routing
- Cross-chain bridging automation
- Portfolio aggregation
- Real-time data feeds

**How it's calculated:**
```
Trade Amount: $1,000
Protocol Fee: $1,000 × 0.1% = $1.00
Total Cost: $1,001.00
```

**When you pay:**
- At the time of trade execution
- Automatically deducted from your trade amount
- Shown clearly before you confirm

<Tip>
  The 0.1% fee is significantly lower than most traditional betting platforms (5-10%) and competitive with other crypto prediction markets.
</Tip>

### Bridge Gas Fees: $1-3

**What it covers:**
- Cross-chain USDC transfers via Circle CCTP
- Destination chain transaction costs
- Message relay fees

**When it applies:**
- Only when trading on markets on different chains
- One-time per chain (not per trade)
- Waived if already on the correct chain

**Cost breakdown:**
```
Source chain transaction: ~$0.50
Bridge relay: ~$1.00
Destination chain: ~$0.50
Total: ~$2.00 (varies by network congestion)
```

**How to minimize:**
- Batch multiple trades on the same chain
- Use Native CLOB for small trades (<$100)
- Trade during low network congestion

### Network Gas Fees

**What it covers:**
- Blockchain validator rewards
- Transaction processing

**Typical costs (Layer 2):**
- Optimism: $0.10 - $0.50
- Base: $0.05 - $0.30
- Polygon: $0.01 - $0.10
- Arbitrum: $0.10 - $0.40

<Info>
  Layer 2 networks are 10-100x cheaper than Ethereum mainnet. This is why Predifi is built on L2s.
</Info>

### Total Aggregator Cost Examples

#### Example 1: Small Trade ($100)
```
Trade Amount: $100
Protocol Fee (0.1%): $0.10
Bridge Gas (if cross-chain): $2.00
Network Gas: $0.50
Total Fees: $2.60 (2.6% of trade)
```

#### Example 2: Medium Trade ($1,000)
```
Trade Amount: $1,000
Protocol Fee (0.1%): $1.00
Bridge Gas (if cross-chain): $2.00
Network Gas: $0.50
Total Fees: $3.50 (0.35% of trade)
```

#### Example 3: Large Trade ($10,000)
```
Trade Amount: $10,000
Protocol Fee (0.1%): $10.00
Bridge Gas (if cross-chain): $2.00
Network Gas: $0.50
Total Fees: $12.50 (0.125% of trade)
```

<Tip>
  **Key insight**: Fixed costs (bridge gas) become negligible on larger trades. Trade size $500+ gets you the best effective fee rate.
</Tip>

## Native CLOB Fees (Detailed)

### Protocol Fee: 2% on Winnings

**What makes it unique:**
- **Only charged on WINNING trades**
- Losers pay $0 protocol fee
- Capped at maximum 5%
- Paid when claiming, not when trading

**How it's calculated:**
```
Winning Position: 1,000 shares
Payout: 1,000 × $1.00 = $1,000
Protocol Fee: $1,000 × 2% = $20
Net Payout: $980
```

**Why this model?**
- Aligns incentives (we only profit when you profit)
- No fee on unsuccessful trades
- Encourages frequent trading
- Fair for all trade sizes

### Trading Gas Fees

**What you pay gas for:**
- Placing market orders: ~$0.50
- Limit orders: FREE (off-chain)
- Canceling orders: FREE (off-chain)
- Settling trades: ~$0.50 (batch settled)
- Claiming winnings: ~$0.50

<Note>
  **Off-chain orders** are a huge advantage. Place and cancel limit orders as much as you want without paying gas!
</Note>

### Total Native CLOB Cost Examples

#### Example 1: Winning Trade
```
Investment: $500 (at $0.65/share)
Shares: 769 shares
Market Resolves: YES wins
Gross Payout: 769 × $1.00 = $769
Protocol Fee (2%): $769 × 2% = $15.38
Gas (trade + claim): $1.00
Total Fees: $16.38
Net Profit: $769 - $500 - $16.38 = $252.62
Effective Fee Rate: 6.1% of profit
```

#### Example 2: Losing Trade
```
Investment: $500
Market Resolves: Against you
Payout: $0
Protocol Fee: $0 (only charged on winners!)
Gas Paid: $0.50 (just the initial trade)
Total Loss: $500.50
```

<Info>
  Notice: Losing trades have almost zero fees. The protocol fee model is winner-focused.
</Info>

## Fee Comparison with Competitors

## Fee Optimization Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trade Larger Amounts" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Fixed costs (bridge gas) are diluted over larger trades. $500+ trades have the best effective rates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Your Trades" icon="layer-group">
    If trading on the same chain/venue, batch multiple positions together to share fixed costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Native CLOB for Small Trades" icon="gauge-simple">
    For trades under $100, avoid cross-chain bridge fees by using Native CLOB.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trade During Off-Peak Hours" icon="clock">
    Network gas fees are lower during low activity periods (nights, weekends in US/Europe).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Limit Orders (Native CLOB)" icon="bullseye">
    Limit orders are FREE to place and cancel. Only pay gas when they execute.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Fee Impact on Small Profits" icon="calculator">
