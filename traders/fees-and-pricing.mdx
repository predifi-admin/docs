## Aggregator Fees

### Protocol Fee: 0.05% - 0.1%

**Covers:** Multi-venue liquidity, smart routing, cross-chain bridging, portfolio aggregation, real-time data.

**Example:**
```
Trade: $1,000
Fee: $1,000 × 0.1% = $1.00
Total: $1,001.00
```

<Tip>
0.1% is significantly lower than traditional betting platforms (5-10%) and competitive with crypto prediction markets.
</Tip>

### Bridge Gas Fees: $1-3

**Covers:** Cross-chain USDC transfers via Circle CCTP, destination chain costs, message relay.

**When:** Only for cross-chain trades, one-time per chain, waived if already on correct chain.

**Cost:** Source tx ~$0.50 + Bridge relay ~$1.00 + Destination ~$0.50 = ~$2.00

**Minimize:** Batch trades on same chain, use Native CLOB for trades &lt;$100, trade during low congestion.

### Network Gas Fees

**Typical L2 costs:**
- Optimism: $0.10 - $0.50
- Base: $0.05 - $0.30
- Polygon: $0.01 - $0.10
- Arbitrum: $0.10 - $0.40

### Total Aggregator Cost Examples

| Trade Size | Protocol Fee | Bridge Gas | Network Gas | Total | Effective Rate |
|------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| $100 | $0.10 | $2.00 | $0.50 | $2.60 | 2.6% |
| $1,000 | $1.00 | $2.00 | $0.50 | $3.50 | 0.35% |
| $10,000 | $10.00 | $2.00 | $0.50 | $12.50 | 0.125% |

<Tip>
Fixed costs (bridge gas) become negligible on larger trades. Trade size $500+ gets best effective rate.
</Tip>

## Native CLOB Fees

### Protocol Fee: 2% on Winnings

**Only charged on WINNING trades.** Losers pay $0 protocol fee. Capped at 5%. Paid when claiming, not trading.

**Example:**
```
Winning: 1,000 shares × $1.00 = $1,000
Fee: $1,000 × 2% = $20
Net Payout: $980
```

**Why:** Aligns incentives (we profit when you profit), no fee on losses, encourages frequent trading, fair for all sizes.

### Trading Gas Fees

- Market orders: ~$0.50
- Limit orders: FREE (off-chain)
- Canceling orders: FREE (off-chain)
- Settling trades: ~$0.50
- Claiming winnings: ~$0.50

<Note>
**Off-chain orders** are a huge advantage. Place and cancel limit orders without paying gas!
</Note>

### Total Native CLOB Cost Examples

```
Investment: $500 (at $0.65/share)
Shares: 769
Payout: $769

- **Batch Your Trades**: Multiple positions on same chain/venue share fixed costs.
- **Use Native CLOB for Small Trades**: Avoid cross-chain fees for trades under $100.
- **Trade During Off-Peak**: Network gas lower during low activity (nights, weekends).
- **Use Limit Orders (Native)**: FREE to place/cancel. Only pay gas when executed.
- **Consider Fee Impact**: $20 trade + $3 fees = 15% rate. Ensure expected profit justifies cost.
