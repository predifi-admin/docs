## Claiming Settled Positions

When a market resolves in your favor, your winnings need to be claimed. This guide walks you through the settlement and claiming process.

---

## How Settlement Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Market Closes">
    Trading stops when event concludes or deadline passes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Outcome Determined">
    Real-world outcome verified (oracle reports or venue resolution)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement Period">
    Dispute/challenge window (typically 1-7 days depending on venue)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Final Settlement">
    Outcome finalized and winnings become claimable
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Claim Winnings">
    Withdraw your winnings to your wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Settlement Times by Venue

| Venue | Total Time | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Predifi Native CLOB** | ~1-2 days | Stork Network oracles with 24h challenge period |
| **Polymarket** | ~2-3 days | UMA optimistic oracle with 48h challenge period |
| **Limitless** | ~1-2 days | Automated + manual review with up to 24h review |

## Checking Claimable Positions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Portfolio">
    Go to **Portfolio → Claimable**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Settled Positions">
    See all resolved markets with your positions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Winning Positions">
    Positions showing positive value are winners you can claim
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Total Amount">
    See total claimable amount across all resolved markets
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payout Formula

$$
\text{Payout} = \text{Shares Held} \times \$1.00
$$

**Example:**
- You hold 500 YES shares on BTC > $100K
- Market resolves YES
- Your payout: 500 × $1.00 = **$500**

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Chain">
    Choose which chain to claim from first
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Claim on That Chain">
    Sign transaction (USDC goes to wallet on that chain)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repeat for Other Chains">
    Switch networks and claim from other chains
  </Step>

### Consolidating USDC

To move all USDC to one chain:
