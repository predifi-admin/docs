## Claiming Settled Positions

When a market resolves in your favor, your winnings need to be claimed. This guide walks you through the settlement and claiming process on Predifi.

---

## How Settlement Works

### Market Resolution Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Market Closes">
    Trading stops when the event concludes or deadline passes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Outcome Determined">
    Real-world outcome is verified (oracle reports or venue resolution)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement Period">
    Dispute/challenge window (typically 1-7 days depending on venue)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Final Settlement">
    Outcome is finalized and winnings become claimable
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Claim Winnings">
    You withdraw your winnings to your wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Settlement Times by Venue

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Predifi Native CLOB">
    **Oracle-based resolution:**
    - Event conclusion: Immediate
    - Oracle report: 5-30 minutes
    - Challenge period: 24 hours
    - Total time: **~1-2 days**
    
    Resolved by Stork Network oracles with verifiable data feeds.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Polymarket">
    **UMA oracle resolution:**
    - Event conclusion: Immediate
    - Proposal period: 2 hours
    - Challenge period: 48 hours
    - Total time: **~2-3 days**
    
    Polymarket uses UMA's optimistic oracle for decentralized resolution.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Limitless">
    **Automated + manual resolution:**
    - Event conclusion: Immediate
    - Automated check: 1-6 hours
    - Manual review: Up to 24 hours
    - Total time: **~1-2 days**
    
    Limitless uses API-based automation with human oversight.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Checking Claimable Positions

### Via Predifi Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Portfolio">
    Go to **Portfolio → Claimable**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Settled Positions">
    See all markets that have resolved with your positions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Winning Positions">
    Positions showing positive value are winners you can claim
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Total Amount">
    See total claimable amount across all resolved markets
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Your Claim Amount

**Winning position payout formula:**

$$
\text{Payout} = \text{Shares Held} \times \$1.00
$$

**Example:**
- You hold 500 shares of "YES" on BTC > $100K
- Market resolves YES
- Your payout: 500 × $1.00 = **$500**

**If you hold losing shares:**
- You hold 300 shares of "NO" on BTC > $100K
- Market resolves YES (not NO)
- Your payout: **$0** (losing shares are worthless)

  <Step title="Select Chain">
    Choose which chain to claim from first

    Sign transaction to claim (USDC goes to wallet on that chain)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repeat for Other Chains">
    Switch networks and claim from other chains
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bridge if Needed (Optional)">

## Troubleshooting Claims

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't See Claimable Position" icon="eye-slash">
    **Possible causes:**
    
    1. **Market hasn't settled yet**
       - Check settlement period status
       - Wait for challenge window to pass
    
    2. **Wrong wallet connected**
       - Verify you're using the wallet that holds the position
       - Check wallet address matches
    
    3. **Position was losing**
       - Verify you bet on the correct outcome
       - Check market resolution outcome
    
    4. **Display issue**
       - Refresh page and clear cache
       - Try different browser
       - Check on blockchain explorer
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Claim Transaction Failing" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Common fixes:**
    
    1. **Insufficient gas**
       - Add ETH (or MATIC/BNB) for gas fees
       - Increase gas limit in wallet
    
    2. **Already claimed**
       - Check transaction history
       - Verify USDC balance increased
    
    3. **Network congestion**
       - Wait 10-20 minutes
       - Try again during off-peak hours
       - Increase gas price for faster confirmation
    
    4. **Contract error**
       - Try claiming through blockchain explorer directly
       - Contact support with error message
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Claim Amount Looks Wrong" icon="calculator">
    **Verify the following:**
    
    1. **Check your share count**
       - How many shares did you actually hold?
       - Did you sell some before resolution?
    
    2. **Winning outcome**
       - Did you bet YES or NO?
       - What was the actual resolution?
    
    3. **Fees already deducted**
       - Trading fees deducted at order time
       - Claim amount reflects net winnings
    
    4. **Partial fills**
       - If limit order only partially filled
       - Check filled amount vs. intended amount
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Claim Shows 'Pending' Forever" icon="hourglass">
    **What to do:**
    
    1. **Check blockchain explorer**
       - Look up your transaction hash
       - See if it's confirmed on-chain
    
    2. **Refresh Predifi dashboard**
       - Sometimes UI lags behind blockchain
       - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
    
    3. **Verify gas paid**
       - Transaction might have failed due to low gas
       - Check wallet for failed transaction
    
    4. **Contact support**
       - Provide transaction hash
       - Screenshot of claim attempt
