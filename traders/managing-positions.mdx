### Closing Positions Entirely

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Market Close">

## Position Management Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Reduce timing risk: Set initial entry (25% target) → Define trigger points → Add gradually → Average down if price moves against you.

**Example:** Buy 100 @ $0.60, add 100 @ $0.55, add 100 @ $0.50 = $0.55 average across 300 shares.

### Taking Profits Systematically

- **25% Rule**: Sell 25% after 25% gain
- **Half-off Rule**: When doubled, sell half to recover initial capital
- **Trailing Stops**: Sell if price drops X% from peak
- **Ladder Exits**: Sell portions at multiple price targets

### Stop-Loss Management

<Warning>
**Important:** Predifi doesn't support automatic stop-losses. Must manually monitor and exit. Set price alerts for stop-loss levels.
</Warning>

**Manual strategy:** Decide max loss (e.g., 20%) → Calculate stop price → Set price alert → Manually close when triggered.

## Multi-Venue Position Management

Predifi aggregates positions from Predifi Native CLOB, Polymarket, and Limitless.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unified View">
    See all positions in one dashboard:
    ```
    Portfolio: $10,450 (+$1,250 / +13.6%)
    ├── Predifi CLOB: $4,200 (5 positions)
    ├── Polymarket: $3,800 (3 positions)
    └── Limitless: $2,450 (2 positions)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cross-Venue Arbitrage">
    Exploit price differences:
    - BTC > $100K: Polymarket @ $0.62, Limitless @ $0.67
    - Buy 1000 shares on Polymarket: -$620
    - Sell 1000 shares on Limitless: +$670
    - Profit: $50 - ~$5 fees = **$45 risk-free**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- **Diversify Positions**: Spread across 5-10 markets, different categories, varied time horizons. Limit single-position exposure to 10-20%.
- **Set Position Limits**: Max position 20% of portfolio, max loss 5% per position, total deployed 50-60%, reserve for averaging down.
- **Use Limit Orders**: Avoid market impact on large positions. Scale in/out with multiple orders.
- **Review Regularly**: Daily P&L checks, weekly position reviews, monthly performance analysis.
- **Track Resolution Dates**: Know when markets resolve. Exit early if odds moved against you.
