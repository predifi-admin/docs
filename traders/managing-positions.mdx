## Position Management Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Reduce timing risk by entering positions gradually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Initial Entry">
    Buy initial position (e.g., 25% of target size)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Trigger Points">
    Set price levels to add more (e.g., every 5% price drop)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Gradually">
    Increase position at predetermined intervals
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Average Down">
    Lower your average cost if price moves against you
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
- Buy 100 shares at $0.60
- Add 100 shares at $0.55
- Add 100 shares at $0.50
- Final average: $0.55 across 300 shares

### Taking Profits Systematically

Lock in gains while maintaining upside:

1. **25% Rule**: Sell 25% of position after 25% gain
2. **Half-off Rule**: When position doubles, sell half (recover initial capital)
3. **Trailing Stops**: Sell if price drops X% from peak
4. **Ladder Exits**: Sell portions at multiple price targets

### Stop-Loss Management

Protect against large losses:

<Warning>
**Important:** Predifi doesn't support automatic stop-losses yet. You must manually monitor and exit positions. Consider setting price alerts to notify you of stop-loss levels.
</Warning>

**Manual stop-loss strategy:**
1. Decide max loss per position (e.g., 20%)
2. Calculate stop price: Entry price × (1 - stop %)
3. Set price alert at stop level
4. When triggered, manually close position

## Multi-Venue Position Management

### Viewing Across Venues

Predifi aggregates positions from:
- **Predifi Native CLOB** - Positions on our orderbook
- **Polymarket** - Aggregated Polymarket positions
- **Limitless** - Base-native market positions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unified View">
    See all positions in one dashboard regardless of venue:
    ```
    Portfolio Overview
    ├── Total Value: $10,450
    ├── Unrealized P&L: +$1,250 (+13.6%)
    │
    ├── Predifi CLOB: $4,200 (5 positions)
    ├── Polymarket: $3,800 (3 positions)
    └── Limitless: $2,450 (2 positions)
    ```

    Filter by venue to see platform-specific details:
    - Venue-specific fees
    - Settlement times
    - Liquidity depth
    - Cross-venue arbitrage opportunities
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Cross-Venue Arbitrage

Identify and exploit price differences:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spot Price Difference">
    Same market trading at different prices on different venues
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Buy Low Venue">
    Purchase shares on the cheaper venue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sell High Venue">
    Simultaneously sell on the more expensive venue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Lock Profit">
    Profit from price discrepancy (minus fees and gas)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
- BTC > $100K by Jan 15: **Polymarket @ $0.62**, **Limitless @ $0.67**
- Buy 1000 shares on Polymarket: -$620
- Sell 1000 shares on Limitless: +$670
- Profit: $50 (minus ~$5 in fees) = **$45 risk-free**

    - Limit single-position exposure (max 10-20% of portfolio)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Position Limits" icon="gauge-high">
    **Define risk per position:**
    - Max position size: 20% of portfolio
