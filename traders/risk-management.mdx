## Risk Management Fundamentals

Successful prediction market trading isn't just about picking winners—it's about **managing risk** to survive losing streaks and compound gains over time.

## Position Sizing Strategies

### Kelly Criterion

Mathematically optimal position sizing based on edge and probability:

$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

Where:
- $f^*$ = Fraction of capital to bet
- $b$ = Odds received (net return ratio)
- $p$ = Probability of winning
- $q$ = Probability of losing $(1-p)$

**Example:**
- Market offers 2:1 odds ($0.33 price)
- You estimate 50% win probability
- Kelly = $(2 \times 0.5 - 0.5) / 2 = 0.25$
- **Bet 25% of capital** (full Kelly)

<Warning>
**Half-Kelly Recommended:** Most professionals use **half-Kelly** (12.5% in example above) to reduce volatility while capturing most gains.
</Warning>

### Fixed Percentage Method

Simpler approach: risk same % of capital per trade.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Conservative (2-5%)">
    **Best for:**
    - Beginners
    - Uncertain markets
    - High volatility
    
    **Example:**
    - $10,000 bankroll
    - 3% per position = $300 max
    - 10 positions = $3,000 deployed (30%)
    
    ✅ Very safe  
    ❌ Slower growth
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Moderate (5-10%)">
    **Best for:**
    - Experienced traders
    - Medium conviction
    - Balanced approach
    
    **Example:**
    - $10,000 bankroll
    - 7% per position = $700 max
    - 10 positions = $7,000 deployed (70%)
    
    ✅ Good balance  
    ⚖️ Moderate risk
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Aggressive (10-20%)">
    **Best for:**
    - Very experienced traders
    - High-conviction plays only
    - High risk tolerance
    
    **Example:**
    - $10,000 bankroll
    - 15% per position = $1,500 max
    - 5 positions = $7,500 deployed (75%)
    
    ⚠️ High risk  
    ✅ Maximum growth potential
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fixed Dollar Amount

Risk same $ amount per trade regardless of capital:

**Pros:**
- Simple to execute
- Easy to track
- Consistent risk per trade

**Cons:**
- Doesn't adjust to gains/losses
- Can become too conservative (with gains) or aggressive (with losses)

**Recommendation:** Adjust fixed amount every month based on current bankroll.

## Diversification

### Portfolio Construction

Build a balanced portfolio across multiple dimensions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Market Category">
    **Diversify by event type:**
    
    | Category | Allocation | Example |
    |----------|------------|---------|
    | Politics | 30% | Elections, policy |
    | Sports | 20% | NFL, NBA games |
    | Crypto | 25% | BTC price, launches |
    | Finance | 15% | Fed decisions, stocks |
    | Entertainment | 10% | Awards, box office |
    
    **Why:** Different categories have uncorrelated outcomes
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Time Horizon">
    **Diversify by resolution date:**
    
    - **Short-term (< 1 week):** 30%
    - **Medium-term (1 week - 1 month):** 40%
    - **Long-term (> 1 month):** 30%
    
    **Why:** Manage liquidity needs and reduce timing risk
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Probability Range">
    **Diversify by market odds:**
    
    - **High probability (70-90%):** 40% - Lower risk, lower return
    - **Medium probability (40-60%):** 35% - Balanced
    - **Low probability (10-30%):** 25% - Higher risk, higher return
    
    **Why:** Blend steady gains with asymmetric upside
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Venue">
    **Diversify across platforms:**
    
    - **Predifi CLOB:** 40%
    - **Polymarket (via aggregator):** 35%
    - **Limitless (via aggregator):** 25%
    
    **Why:** Reduce venue-specific risks (oracle failures, smart contract bugs)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Correlation Risk

Avoid positions that move together:

<Warning>
**Bad Diversification Example:**
- BTC > $100K
- ETH > $4K
- Crypto market cap > $3T
- Coinbase stock > $300

All these move together! If crypto crashes, **all positions lose.**
</Warning>

<Info>
**Good Diversification Example:**
- BTC > $100K (crypto)
- Trump wins 2024 election (politics)
- Lakers win NBA championship (sports)
- Apple stock > $200 (tech stocks)

These are **uncorrelated**—winning/losing independently.
</Info>

## Stop-Loss Strategies

### Manual Stop-Losses

Predifi doesn't support automatic stop-losses yet. Use manual approach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Stop Price">
    Decide max loss per position (e.g., 20%)
    
    Entry: $0.50 → Stop: $0.40
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Price Alert">
    Set alert in Predifi when position hits stop level
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute Stop">
    When alert triggers, manually close position immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No Exceptions">
    **Honor your stop!** Don't hope it bounces back.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Time-Based Stops

Exit positions based on time, not price:

**Strategy:** If market hasn't moved in your favor after X days, exit.

**Example:**
- Enter position on Monday
- Set 7-day time stop
- If not profitable by next Monday, close regardless of price
- Redeploy capital to better opportunities

**Why:** Avoid dead money sitting in stagnant positions

### Trailing Stops

Lock in profits as position moves in your favor:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fixed Trailing Stop">
    **Move stop-loss up as price rises:**
    
    - Buy at $0.40
    - Price rises to $0.60 (+50%)
    - Set trailing stop at $0.55 (locking in +37.5% profit)
    - If price drops to $0.55, exit
    - If price rises to $0.70, move stop to $0.65
    
    **Rule:** Keep stop 10-15% below current price
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Percentage Trailing Stop">
    **Trail by percentage:**
    
    - Buy at $0.50
    - Set 20% trailing stop
    - Price peaks at $0.80
    - Stop level: $0.64 (80% of peak)
    - Exit if price drops to $0.64
    
    **Captures:** 80% of max profit
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Bankroll Management

### The 3-Tier System

Structure your capital for optimal risk management:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tier 1: Active (50-60%)">
    **Deployed in current positions**
    
    - 10-15 open positions
    - Actively managed
    - Regular trading
    
    **$10K Example:** $5,000-6,000 active
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tier 2: Reserve (30-40%)">
    **Ready to deploy for opportunities**
    
    - Add to winning positions
    - Average down on high-conviction losers
    - Jump on mispriced markets
    
    **$10K Example:** $3,000-4,000 reserve
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tier 3: Emergency (10%)">
    **Never touch except for rare opportunities**
    
    - Massive mispricings
    - Black swan events
    - Recovery from drawdowns
    
    **$10K Example:** $1,000 emergency only
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Drawdown Management

What to do when losing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize Drawdown">
    You're down 10%+ from peak
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reduce Position Sizes">
    Cut position sizing by 30-50%
    
    Example: 5% per trade → 2.5% per trade
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tighten Criteria">
    Only take highest-conviction trades
    
    Skip marginal opportunities
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Strategy">
    Analyze what went wrong
    
    Adjust if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grind Back Slowly">
    Small, consistent wins rebuild capital
    
    Don't try to win it all back at once
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Stop-Loss Rule:** If down 30% from peak, **stop trading for 1 week**. Take a break, reassess, and return with fresh perspective.
</Warning>

## Advanced Risk Techniques

### Hedging

Protect positions with offsetting bets:

**Example:**
- You're long BTC > $100K at $0.55 (545 shares, $300 cost)
- BTC pumps to $98K, odds now $0.75
- Concerned about volatility before expiry
- **Hedge:** Buy $0.15 worth of NO ($150 cost, 1000 shares)

**Outcomes:**
- BTC > $100K: YES wins ($545 profit - $300 cost - $150 hedge = **+$95**)
- BTC < $100K: NO wins ($1000 profit - $300 cost - $150 hedge = **+$550**)

**Why hedge:** Lock in profits, reduce stress, protect against volatility

### Options-Style Strategies

Use prediction markets like options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Long Straddle">
    **Buy both YES and NO when expecting big move:**
    
    - Market: BTC between $95K-$105K
    - Price: $0.50 YES, $0.50 NO
    - Buy 500 shares each ($250 + $250 = $500 cost)
    
    **If huge volatility:**
    - YES shoots to $0.90 → Sell for $450 profit
    - NO crashes to $0.10
    - Net: $450 - $500 = -$50 loss (but captured massive move)
    
    **Use:** High volatility expected, direction uncertain
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Spread Trading">
    **Buy low prob, sell high prob on same underlying:**
    
    - Buy: BTC > $110K at $0.20 (500 shares, $100 cost)
    - Sell: BTC > $95K at $0.80 (500 shares, $400 proceeds)
    - Net: $300 credit received
    
    **Outcomes:**
    - BTC < $95K: Keep $300 (max profit)
    - BTC $95K-$110K: Lose on one, win on other
    - BTC > $110K: Lose $200 (max loss)
    
    **Use:** Defined risk/reward, range-bound expectations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
