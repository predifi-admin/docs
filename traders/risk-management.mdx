## Risk Management Fundamentals

Successful prediction market trading requires **managing risk** to survive losing streaks and compound gains over time.

<Warning>

## Position Sizing

### Fixed Percentage Method

Risk same % of capital per trade:

| Approach | Risk per Position | Best For | Example ($10K bankroll) |
|----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Conservative** | 2-5% | Beginners, uncertain markets | $300 per position (10 positions = 30% deployed) |
| **Moderate** | 5-10% | Experienced traders | $700 per position (10 positions = 70% deployed) |
| **Aggressive** | 10-20% | Very experienced, high conviction | $1,500 per position (5 positions = 75% deployed) |

### Kelly Criterion

Mathematically optimal position sizing:

$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

Where:
- $f^*$ = Fraction of capital to bet
- $b$ = Odds received (net return ratio)
- $p$ = Probability of winning
- $q$ = Probability of losing $(1-p)$

**Example:**
- Market offers 2:1 odds ($0.33 price)
- You estimate 50% win probability
- Kelly = $(2 \times 0.5 - 0.5) / 2 = 0.25$ (25% of capital)

<Warning>
**Half-Kelly Recommended:** Most professionals use **half-Kelly** to reduce volatility while capturing most gains.
</Warning>

## Diversification

### Portfolio Construction

Diversify across multiple dimensions:

**By Category:**
- Politics: 30%
- Crypto: 25%
- Sports: 20%
- Finance: 15%
- Entertainment: 10%

**By Time Horizon:**
- Short-term (< 1 week): 30%
- Medium-term (1 week - 1 month): 40%
- Long-term (> 1 month): 30%

**By Probability:**
- High (70-90%): 40% - Lower risk, lower return
- Medium (40-60%): 35% - Balanced
- Low (10-30%): 25% - Higher risk, higher return

### Correlation Risk

Avoid positions that move together:

<Warning>
**Bad Diversification:**
- BTC > $100K
- ETH > $4K
- Crypto market cap > $3T

All move together! If crypto crashes, **all positions lose.**
</Warning>

<Info>
**Good Diversification:**
- BTC > $100K (crypto)
- Trump wins 2024 (politics)
- Lakers win NBA championship (sports)

These are **uncorrelated**—win/lose independently.
</Info>

## Stop-Loss Strategies

### Manual Stop-Losses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Stop Price">
    Decide max loss per position (e.g., 20%)
    
    Entry: $0.50 → Stop: $0.40
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Price Alert">
    Set alert when position hits stop level
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute Stop">
    When alert triggers, close position immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No Exceptions">
    **Honor your stop!** Don't hope it bounces back.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Trailing Stops

Lock in profits as position moves in your favor:

**Fixed Trailing Stop:**
- Buy at $0.40
- Price rises to $0.60 (+50%)
- Set trailing stop at $0.55 (locking in +37.5% profit)
- If price rises to $0.70, move stop to $0.65
- **Rule:** Keep stop 10-15% below current price

## Bankroll Management

### The 3-Tier System

| Tier | % of Capital | Purpose | Example ($10K) |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Active** | 50-60% | Deployed in current positions (10-15 open) | $5,000-6,000 |
| **Reserve** | 30-40% | Add to winners, jump on opportunities | $3,000-4,000 |
| **Emergency** | 10% | Rare opportunities, recovery from drawdowns | $1,000 |

### Drawdown Management

What to do when losing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize Drawdown">
    You're down 10%+ from peak
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reduce Position Sizes">
    Cut position sizing by 30-50%
    
    Example: 5% per trade → 2.5% per trade
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tighten Criteria">
    Only take highest-conviction trades
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Strategy">
    Analyze what went wrong, adjust if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grind Back Slowly">
    Small, consistent wins rebuild capital
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Circuit Breaker:** If down 30% from peak, **stop trading for 1 week**. Take a break, reassess, and return with fresh perspective.
</Warning>

## Risk Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Win Rate** | >55% | % of positions that profit |
| **Win/Loss Ratio** | >1.5:1 | Avg win size / Avg loss size |
| **Max Drawdown** | &lt;25% | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | >1.0 | Risk-adjusted returns |
| **ROI** | >20% annually | Total return on investment |
| **Capital at Risk** | 50-70% | % of bankroll in open positions |

    **Risk:** Thinking you're smarter than the market.
    
    **Signs:** Increasing position sizes after wins, ignoring stop-losses

## Risk Management by Experience Level

|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Beginner** (< 6 months) | 2-3% max | 20-30% | 15-20% | Focus on learning, avoid big losses |
| **Intermediate** (6-18 months) | 5-7% typical, 10% max | 50-60% | 15-25% | Build edge, compound gains |
| **Advanced** (18+ months) | 5-10% typical, 20% max | 60-75% | Variable | Maximize risk-adjusted returns |

## Emergency Protocols

### Circuit Breakers

Automatic trading pauses when things go wrong:

1. **Daily Loss Limit:** Down 5% in one day → Stop trading
2. **Weekly Loss Limit:** Down 10% in one week → Reassess strategy
3. **Monthly Loss Limit:** Down 20% in one month → Stop trading 1 week
4. **Peak Drawdown:** Down 30% from peak → Stop trading 2-4 weeks

<Warning>
**Honor your circuit breakers!** These prevent small losses from becoming catastrophic.
</Warning>

## Advanced Techniques

### Hedging

Protect positions with offsetting bets:

**Example:**
- Long BTC > $100K at $0.55 (545 shares, $300 cost)
- BTC pumps, odds now $0.75
- **Hedge:** Buy $150 of NO (1000 shares)

**Outcomes:**
- BTC > $100K: YES wins (+$95 profit)
- BTC < $100K: NO wins (+$550 profit)

**Why hedge:** Lock in profits, reduce stress, protect against volatility
