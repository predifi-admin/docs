## Bridging Made Simple

Predifi integrates best-in-class bridging solutions to enable **frictionless movement** of assets across chains. Trade on any chain without worrying about moving your funds.

> 🌉 **USDC on Chain A → Circle CCTP / Wormhole → USDC on Chain B → Start Trading**

---

## Why Cross-Chain Bridging?

**The Problem:** Different prediction markets exist on different chains
- Polymarket on Polygon
- Limitless on Base  
- Others on Arbitrum, Optimism

**The Solution:** Bridge assets automatically so you can trade anywhere from any chain.

---

## Circle CCTP

### What is CCTP?

**Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol** enables native USDC transfers between blockchains.

**How It Works:**
1. **Burn** - USDC burned on source chain
2. **Attest** - Circle verifies the burn
3. **Mint** - Native USDC minted on destination chain

**Key Benefits:**
- **Native USDC** - Not wrapped tokens
- **Zero fees** - No bridge protocol fees (only gas)
- **Secure** - Direct burn/mint by Circle
- **Simple** - No liquidity pools required

### Supported Routes

**Live Routes:**
- Arbitrum ↔ Polygon, Base, Optimism
- Base ↔ Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism  
- Polygon ↔ Arbitrum, Base, Optimism
- Optimism ↔ Arbitrum, Base, Polygon

**Bridge Time:** ~15 minutes

**Cost Examples:**
- Arbitrum → Base: ~$0.10 gas
- Base → Polygon: ~$0.05 gas
- Polygon → Arbitrum: ~$0.15 gas

### When We Use CCTP

**Primary use:** Moving USDC for trade execution

**Example:** User on Arbitrum wants to trade on Polymarket (Polygon)
1. User deposits USDC to Arbitrum LP Vault
2. Protocol bridges via CCTP: Arbitrum → Polygon
3. Smart AA Wallet receives native USDC on Polygon
4. Execute trade on Polymarket
5. Profits returned to vault

## Wormhole

### What is Wormhole?

**Wormhole** is a generic cross-chain messaging protocol connecting 30+ blockchains.

**How It Works:**
1. **Lock** - Assets locked on source chain
2. **Verify** - Guardian network validates
3. **Mint** - Wrapped assets minted on destination
4. **Transfer** - User receives tokens

**Key Benefits:**
- **Generic** - Works with any token
- **Fast** - 1-2 minute finality
- **Secure** - 19-validator guardian network
- **Battle-tested** - $10B+ in volume

### When We Use Wormhole

**Primary use:** Bridging YES/NO position tokens back to user chains

**Example:** After trading on Polymarket (Polygon), bridge tokens to Arbitrum
1. User has YES tokens on Polygon
2. Lock YES tokens in Wormhole contract
3. Wormhole mints wrapped YES on Arbitrum
4. User receives tokens in wallet

**Also used for:**
- Non-CCTP chains
- Emergency fallback bridging
- Future non-USDC asset support

## Bridge Comparison

| Bridge | Assets | Time | Cost | Security | Use Case |
|--------|--------|------|------|----------|----------|
| **CCTP** | USDC only | 15 min | $0 + gas | Native (Circle) | Primary USDC bridging |
| **Wormhole** | Any token | 1-2 min | ~$0.50 | Guardian network | Position tokens |

**Why two bridges?**
- CCTP for USDC (cheaper, native)
- Wormhole for everything else (flexible)

---

## User Experience

### Automatic Bridging

**Users never interact with bridges directly:**

1. Select market on any chain
2. Click "Trade"
3. Protocol handles all bridging
4. Receive confirmation when complete

**You don't need to:**
- Manually approve bridge contracts
- Wait for bridge confirmations
- Manage wrapped tokens
- Understand technical details

### Bridge Status Tracking

**In your portfolio:**
- See pending bridges in real-time
- Estimated completion time
- Transaction links for verification
- Automatic retry if bridge fails

## Developer Access

### Bridge USDC via API

```typescript
// Bridge USDC using CCTP
const bridge = await predifi.bridge({
  asset: 'USDC',
  amount: 100,
  from: 'arbitrum',
  to: 'polygon',
  recipient: '0x...'
});

console.log(bridge.status); // 'pending'
console.log(bridge.estimatedTime); // '~15 minutes'
```

### Bridge Tokens via Wormhole

```typescript
// Bridge position tokens
const bridge = await predifi.bridge({
  asset: 'YES-TOKEN',
  amount: 50,
  from: 'polygon',
  to: 'arbitrum',
  recipient: '0x...'
});
```
