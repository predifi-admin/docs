## True Chain-Agnostic Trading

Predifi's architecture separates **user funds** from **trade execution**. Your assets stay on your preferred chain in LP Vaults, while our Smart Account Abstraction layer executes trades on the most liquid venue chains—all seamlessly.

> 🌐 **Your Funds (Any Chain) → LP Vault → Smart AA Wallet → Trade Execution (Venue Chain) → Profits Back to You**

---

## How It Works

**Two-Layer Architecture:**

1. **User Layer (Your Chain)** - Your USDC stays in LP Vaults on your preferred chain
2. **Execution Layer (Venue Chain)** - Smart AA Wallets execute trades where liquidity is best

**Example Flow:** User on Arbitrum trades on Polymarket (Polygon)

1. Deposit USDC to Arbitrum LP Vault
2. Request trade on Polymarket market
3. Protocol bridges USDC via CCTP (Arbitrum → Polygon)
4. Smart AA Wallet executes trade on Polygon
5. YES/NO tokens bridged back to your Arbitrum wallet
6. When market resolves, winnings returned to vault

**Total time:** ~2-3 minutes

## Supported Chains

### Mainnet (Live)

| Chain | Use Case | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Arbitrum** | User funds, LP Vaults | Low gas (~$0.10/tx) |
| **Base** | User funds, LP Vaults | Very low gas (~$0.05/tx) |
| **Polygon** | Polymarket execution | Low gas (~$0.02/tx) |
| **Optimism** | Coming soon | Low gas |

### Why These Chains?

- **Low fees** - Cost-effective for all users
- **Fast finality** - Quick confirmations (1-2 seconds)
- **EVM compatible** - Easy integration
- **Battle-tested** - Billions in TVL

## Smart Account Abstraction

### What is Account Abstraction?

Smart AA Wallets are smart contract wallets that enable gasless transactions and automated execution.

**Powered by Alchemy:**
- **Gas abstraction** - Protocol pays gas fees
- **Batch transactions** - Multiple actions in one tx
- **Social recovery** - Backup wallet access
- **Session keys** - Temporary permission delegation

**For users:**
- No gas token needed on execution chain
- Seamless cross-chain trading
- One-click trade execution

## Bridging Technology

### CCTP (Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)

## Bridging Technology

### CCTP (Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)

**For USDC transfers:**
- Native USDC (not wrapped tokens)
- ~15 minute finality
- No bridge risk
- $0 bridge fees

### Wormhole

**For token transfers:**
- YES/NO position tokens
- Fast bridging (1-2 minutes)
- Secure messaging
- Multi-chain support

## Developer Access

Chain-agnostic trading via API:

```typescript
// Trade from any chain
const trade = await predifi.trade({
  userChain: 'arbitrum',      // Where your funds are
  venueChain: 'polygon',       // Where trade executes
  market: 'polymarket-btc-100k',
  amount: 100,
  outcome: 'YES'
});

// Protocol handles all bridging automatically
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need gas tokens on execution chains?" icon="gas-pump">
    No. The protocol's Smart AA Wallets handle all gas fees on execution chains. You only need USDC on your preferred chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does cross-chain trading take?" icon="clock">
    Typically 2-3 minutes total:
    - CCTP bridging: ~15 minutes
    - Trade execution: <1 minute
    - Token bridging back: 1-2 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a bridge fails?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Protocol monitors all bridges. If a transfer fails, funds are automatically returned to your LP Vault on the origin chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw during active trades?" icon="circle-question">
    You can withdraw available balance anytime. Funds locked in active trades become available once positions are closed or claimed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which chain should I use?" icon="map">
    Choose based on fees:
    - **Base** - Lowest fees (~$0.05/tx)
    - **Arbitrum** - Low fees, most popular (~$0.10/tx)
    - **Polygon** - Direct Polymarket access (~$0.02/tx)
