## Price Feeds That Power Predictions

Prediction markets live or die by **data accuracy**. Predifi uses **Stork Network** to deliver ultra-low-latency, manipulation-resistant price feeds that ensure fair market resolution.

> 📡 **Real-World Events → Stork Oracles → On-Chain Data → Market Resolution → Fair Payouts**

---

## Why Oracles Matter

**The Challenge:** Blockchains can't access external data

- "Will Bitcoin reach $100K?" → Need BTC price data
- "Will ETH hit $5K?" → Need ETH price data
- "Will SOL reach $200?" → Need SOL price data

**The Solution:** Or

acles fetch off-chain data and deliver it on-chain securely and reliably.

## Stork Network

### What is Stork?

Stork is a **pull-based oracle** providing ultra-low-latency, manipulation-resistant price feeds for DeFi.

**Key Stats:**
- **&lt;400ms latency** - Exchange to blockchain
- **40+ publishers** - Independent data providers
- **50+ price feeds** - All major crypto assets
- **±0.05% accuracy** - True market price

### How It Works

1. **Publishers fetch data** - From Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit (&lt;100ms)
2. **Stork aggregates** - Median of all publisher prices (&lt;200ms)
3. **On-chain delivery** - When requested by smart contracts (&lt;100ms)
4. **Market resolution** - Predifi uses verified prices to settle markets

**Pull-Based Model:**
- Prices delivered on-demand
- Pay only when you need data
- Always get latest price
- No stale data risk

## Market Resolution Process

**How Markets Settle:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Market Expires">
    Market reaches its expiration time (e.g., "BTC > $100K by Dec 31, 2024")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fetch Oracle Price">
    Protocol queries Stork for BTC price at expiration timestamp
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Price">
    Check price against condition (BTC > $100K?)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolve Market">
    If YES: YES tokens worth $1, NO tokens worth $0
    If NO: YES tokens worth $0, NO tokens worth $1
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Claims">
    Winners can claim their winnings immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Resolution Time:** Usually within 15 minutes of market expiration

## Data Accuracy

### Multi-Source Aggregation

Stork aggregates from 5+ exchanges per asset:

**Process:**
1. Fetch from Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit
2. Remove outliers (prices >5% from median)
3. Calculate median price
4. Verify against historical data
5. Deliver on-chain

**Result:** Typical deviation &lt;0.05% from true market price

### Publisher Network

**40+ Independent Publishers:**
- Geographic distribution (US, EU, Asia)
- Staked reputation system
- Automated outlier detection
- Incentivized accuracy

**Penalties for:**
- Incorrect prices
- Downtime
- Manipulation attempts

## Price Feed Reliability

### Monitoring & Alerts

**We monitor:**
- **High Latency** - If updates take >2 seconds
- **Low Participation** - If &lt;30 publishers submitting
- **High Deviation** - If price varies >5% between publishers
- **Stale Data** - If price not updated in 60+ seconds
- **Oracle Failure** - If Stork unavailable

**If issues detected:**
1. Automatic fallback to backup oracle
2. Delay market resolution until fixed
3. Alert team immediately
4. Investigate root cause

### Uptime & Performance

- **99.99% uptime** - Historical average
- **&lt;400ms latency** - 95th percentile
- **24/7 monitoring** - Real-time alerts
- **Redundant infrastructure** - Multiple data centers

## Comparison to Other Oracles

| Oracle | Latency | Cost | Update Frequency | Best For |
|--------|---------|------|------------------|----------|
| **Stork** | &lt;400ms | ~$0.01/use | Real-time | Fast markets |
| Chainlink | ~60s | ~$0.50/update | Hourly | Traditional markets |
| Pyth | ~400ms | Variable | Real-time | High-frequency |
| API3 | ~30s | ~$0.20/update | On-demand | Flexibility |

**Why We Chose Stork:**
- Lowest latency for crypto markets
- Cost-effective pay-per-use model
- Proven manipulation resistance
- Easy integration

## Developer Access

### Query Oracle Prices

```typescript
// Get current BTC price
const price = await stork.getPrice('BTC/USD');

console.log({
  price: price.value,      // $98,450.23
  timestamp: price.time,    // 1704067200
  confidence: price.conf,   // ±$10.50
  publishers: price.pubs    // 42
});
```

### Resolve Market

```typescript
// Resolve market using oracle
const resolution = await predifi.resolveMarket({
  marketId: 'btc-100k-dec-2024',
  oraclePrice: await stork.getPrice('BTC/USD', {
    timestamp: marketExpirationTime
  })
});
```

## Security

### Oracle Security Measures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Publisher Verification" icon="users">
    40+ independent publishers must agree. Single publisher cannot manipulate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Median Aggregation" icon="chart-line">
    Median (not average) removes outlier manipulation attempts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Staked Reputation" icon="coins">
    Publishers stake tokens. Lose stake for bad data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Historical Verification" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Prices checked against historical patterns. Anomalies flagged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Geographic Distribution" icon="globe">
    Publishers in US, EU, Asia. No single jurisdiction control.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Backup Systems

- **Secondary oracle** - Chainlink fallback
- **Manual resolution** - For disputed markets
- **Governance override** - Community vote in emergencies
- **Insurance fund** - Covers oracle failures

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if Stork goes down?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    We have Chainlink as backup oracle. If both fail, market resolution is delayed until fixed. No funds at risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can oracle prices be manipulated?" icon="shield-halved">
    Very difficult. Would require controlling 20+ of 40+ independent publishers simultaneously. Median aggregation removes outliers automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are the prices?" icon="bullseye">
    Stork aggregates from 5+ sources per feed and uses median calculation. Typical deviation is &lt;0.05% from true price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a price is wrong?" icon="circle-question">
    Markets have a 24-hour dispute period. If price is proven incorrect, market is re-resolved with correct price. Insurance fund covers discrepancies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I verify oracle prices myself?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Yes. All oracle data is on-chain and verifiable. Check publisher signatures and compare to exchange APIs.
