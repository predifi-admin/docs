## What Are Odds?

In prediction markets, **odds represent the probability** of an event happening. Understanding odds is essential for profitable trading.

---

## Price = Probability

<Tip>
**Market Price = Market's Estimated Probability**

A $0.70 YES price means the market thinks there's a **70% chance** the event occurs.
</Tip>

---

## Reading Market Prices

| YES Price | NO Price | Probability | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| $0.90 | $0.10 | 90% | Almost certain |
| $0.75 | $0.25 | 75% | Likely |
| $0.50 | $0.50 | 50% | Toss-up (even) |
| $0.25 | $0.75 | 25% | Unlikely |
| $0.10 | $0.90 | 10% | Very unlikely |

<Info>
**Important:** YES price + NO price should equal ~$1.00 (minus fees and spread)
</Info>

## Converting to Traditional Odds

### Decimal Odds

$$
\text{Decimal Odds} = \frac{1}{\text{Price}}
$$

**Examples:** Price $0.50 → 2.0 (even) | Price $0.33 → 3.0 (2:1) | Price $0.25 → 4.0 (3:1)

### Fractional Odds (British)

$$
\text{Fractional Odds} = \frac{1 - \text{Price}}{\text{Price}}
$$

**Examples:** $0.50 → 1/1 ("evens") | $0.67 → 1/2 ("2 to 1 on") | $0.33 → 2/1 ("2 to 1 against")

### American Odds

**Favorites (>$0.50):**

$$
\text{American Odds} = -\frac{\text{Price}}{1 - \text{Price}} \times 100
$$

**Underdogs (&lt;$0.50):**

$$
\text{American Odds} = \frac{1 - \text{Price}}{\text{Price}} \times 100
$$

**Examples:** $0.67 → -200 (favorite) | $0.50 → +100 (even) | $0.33 → +200 (underdog)

## Implied Probability vs. True Probability

### Finding Value

**Key to profitability:**

1. **Implied probability** = Market price suggests (e.g., $0.60 = 60%)
2. **True probability** = Your analysis (e.g., 70%)
3. **Edge** = True - Implied (70% - 60% = **10% edge**)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Positive Edge (BET)">
    **Your analysis > Market**
    
    Market: $0.60 (60%) | Your analysis: 70% | **Action:** BUY YES | **Edge:** +10%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Negative Edge (PASS)">
    **Your analysis < Market**
    
    Market: $0.60 (60%) | Your analysis: 50% | **Action:** DON'T BUY | **Edge:** -10%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="No Edge (PASS)">
    **Your analysis = Market**
    
    Market: $0.60 (60%) | Your analysis: 60% | **Action:** DON'T BUY | **Edge:** 0%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Expected Value (EV)

Calculate if a bet is profitable long-term:

$$
EV = (P_{\text{win}} \times \text{Profit}) - (P_{\text{lose}} \times \text{Loss})
$$

### Example

**Market:** BTC > $100K at $0.60 | **Your bet:** $100 (166.67 shares) | **Your analysis:** 70% chance

**Calculate:**
- **If win:** ($1.00 × 166.67) - $100 = $66.67
- **If lose:** -$100

$$
EV = (0.70 \times \$66.67) - (0.30 \times \$100) = \$46.67 - \$30 = +\$16.67
$$

**Interpretation:** Positive EV of $16.67. Over many similar bets, you'd average $16.67 profit per $100.

<Info>
**Rule:** Only make bets with positive EV. Over time, positive EV bets are profitable even if individual bets lose.

## The Bid-Ask Spread

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bid Price" icon="arrow-down">
    **Price buyers pay**: $0.58 (You sell at bid)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Ask Price" icon="arrow-up">
    **Price sellers ask**: $0.62 (You buy at ask)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Spread = $0.62 - $0.58 = $0.04 (4 cents)**

<Warning>
**Wider spreads = Higher cost**. Prefer markets with tight spreads (1-3 cents).
</Warning>

## Common Probability Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overconfidence">
    **Mistake:** Thinking you know more than market. Believing 90% when market says 60%.
    
    **Fix:** Be humble. Re-examine if you differ significantly from market.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gambler's Fallacy">
    **Mistake:** Past outcomes affect future probabilities. "Coin landed heads 5 times, tails is due."
    
    **Fix:** Each event is independent. Past doesn't predict future unless causation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confirmation Bias">
    **Mistake:** Only seeking confirming information. Ignoring bearish news when long.
    
    **Fix:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Play devil's advocate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recency Bias">
    **Mistake:** Overweighting recent events. "BTC pumps 20% → going to $200K!"
    
    **Fix:** Consider full history, not just recent. Zoom out.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implied Odds Example

**Market:** "Will it rain tomorrow?" | **Weather forecast:** 60% rain

**Market prices:** YES (rain) $0.70, NO $0.30

**Analysis:**
- Market implies 70% rain
- Weather forecast: 60%
- **Market overvaluing rain by 10%**

**Action:** Buy NO at $0.30

**EV:** (0.40 × $0.70) - (0.60 × $0.30) = $0.28 - $0.18 = **+$0.10/share**

## Kelly Criterion for Position Sizing

**Optimal bet sizing:**

$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

Where: $f^*$ = Fraction to bet | $b$ = Odds received | $p$ = Win probability | $q$ = Lose probability

**Example:**
- Buy YES at $0.60 (0.667 odds)
- Estimate 70% win probability
- Kelly = $(0.667 \times 0.70 - 0.30) / 0.667 = 0.316$
- **Bet 31.6% of bankroll** (full Kelly)

<Info>
**Half-Kelly:** Most pros use half-Kelly (15.8% in example) to reduce volatility.
