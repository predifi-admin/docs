## What Are Odds?

In prediction markets, **odds represent the probability** of an event happening. Understanding how to read and calculate odds is essential for profitable trading.

---

## Price = Probability

The fundamental concept:

<Frame>
  <div style={{padding: '20px', background: '#f0fdf4', borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid #86efac'}}>
    **Market Price = Market's Estimated Probability**
    
    A $0.70 YES price means the market thinks there's a **70% chance** the event occurs.
  </div>
</Frame>

## Reading Market Prices

| YES Price | NO Price | Probability | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| $0.90 | $0.10 | 90% | Almost certain to happen |
| $0.75 | $0.25 | 75% | Likely to happen |
| $0.50 | $0.50 | 50% | Toss-up (even odds) |
| $0.25 | $0.75 | 25% | Unlikely to happen |
| $0.10 | $0.90 | 10% | Very unlikely |

<Info>
**Important:** YES price + NO price should equal ~$1.00 (minus fees and bid-ask spread)
</Info>

## Converting to Traditional Odds

### Decimal Odds

$$
\text{Decimal Odds} = \frac{1}{\text{Price}}
$$

**Examples:**
- Price $0.50 → 2.0 decimal odds (even money)
- Price $0.33 → 3.0 decimal odds (2:1 against)
- Price $0.25 → 4.0 decimal odds (3:1 against)

### Fractional Odds (British)

$$
\text{Fractional Odds} = \frac{1 - \text{Price}}{\text{Price}}
$$

**Examples:**
- Price $0.50 → 1/1 odds ("evens")
- Price $0.67 → 1/2 odds ("2 to 1 on")
- Price $0.33 → 2/1 odds ("2 to 1 against")

### American Odds

**For favorites (price > $0.50):**

$$
\text{American Odds} = -\frac{\text{Price}}{1 - \text{Price}} \times 100
$$

**For underdogs (price < $0.50):**

$$
\text{American Odds} = \frac{1 - \text{Price}}{\text{Price}} \times 100
$$

**Examples:**
- Price $0.67 → -200 (favorite)
- Price $0.50 → +100 (even)
- Price $0.33 → +200 (underdog)

## Implied Probability vs. True Probability

### Finding Value

**The key to profitable trading:**

1. **Implied probability** = What market price suggests (e.g., $0.60 = 60%)
2. **True probability** = Your analysis of actual likelihood (e.g., you think 70%)
3. **Edge** = True probability - Implied probability (70% - 60% = **10% edge**)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Positive Edge (BET)">
    **Your analysis > Market price**
    
    - Market: $0.60 (60% implied)
    - Your analysis: 70% actual chance
    - **Action:** BUY YES (market undervaluing)
    - **Edge:** +10%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Negative Edge (PASS)">
    **Your analysis < Market price**
    
    - Market: $0.60 (60% implied)
    - Your analysis: 50% actual chance
    - **Action:** DON'T BUY (market overvaluing)
    - **Edge:** -10%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="No Edge (PASS)">
    **Your analysis = Market price**
    
    - Market: $0.60 (60% implied)
    - Your analysis: 60% actual chance
    - **Action:** DON'T BUY (no advantage)
    - **Edge:** 0%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Expected Value (EV)

Calculate if a bet is profitable long-term:

$$
EV = (P_{\text{win}} \times \text{Profit}) - (P_{\text{lose}} \times \text{Loss})
$$

### Example Calculation

**Market:** BTC > $100K by Jan 15 at $0.60

**Your bet:** $100 (166.67 shares)

**Your analysis:** 70% chance of occurring

**Calculate EV:**
- **If win:** Profit = ($1.00 × 166.67) - $100 = $66.67
- **If lose:** Loss = $100

$$
EV = (0.70 \times \$66.67) - (0.30 \times \$100) = \$46.67 - \$30 = +\$16.67
$$

**Interpretation:** This bet has a **positive expected value of $16.67**. Over many similar bets, you'd average $16.67 profit per $100 wagered.

<Info>
**Rule:** Only make bets with positive EV. Over time, positive EV bets are profitable even if individual bets lose.
</Info>

## Calculating Your Break-Even

**What price do you need to profit?**

### If Buying YES

$$
\text{Break-Even Price} = \text{Your Entry Price}
$$

**Example:**
- You buy YES at $0.65
- Break-even: Market must resolve YES (final price = $1.00)
- **Profit if market > $0.65 and resolves YES**

### If Selling Before Resolution

$$
\text{Break-Even Sell Price} = \text{Entry Price} + \text{Fees}
$$

**Example:**
- Buy at $0.60, fees $0.01
- Break-even sell: $0.61
- **Profit if you can sell above $0.61**

## The Bid-Ask Spread

Markets have two prices:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bid Price" icon="arrow-down">
    **Price buyers are willing to pay**
    
    Example: $0.58
    
    (You sell at bid price)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Ask Price" icon="arrow-up">
    **Price sellers are asking**
    
    Example: $0.62
    
    (You buy at ask price)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Spread = Ask - Bid = $0.62 - $0.58 = $0.04 (4 cents)**

<Warning>
**Wider spreads = Higher cost** to enter and exit positions. Prefer markets with tight spreads (1-3 cents).
</Warning>

## Common Probability Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overconfidence" icon="head-side-brain">
    **Mistake:** Thinking you know more than the market
    
    - Believing 90% probability when market says 60%
    - Ignoring market wisdom
    - Not adjusting for uncertainty
    
    **Fix:** Be humble. If your estimate differs significantly from the market, re-examine your analysis.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gambler's Fallacy" icon="dice">
    **Mistake:** Thinking past outcomes affect future probabilities
    
    - "Coin landed heads 5 times, tails is 'due'"
    - "Team lost last 3 games, must win next one"
    
    **Fix:** Each event is independent. Past doesn't predict future unless there's causation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confirmation Bias" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Mistake:** Only seeking information that confirms your view
    
    - Ignoring bearish news when you're long
    - Dismissing bullish data when you're short
    
    **Fix:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Play devil's advocate with yourself.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recency Bias" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Mistake:** Overweighting recent events
    
    - BTC pumps 20% → "It's going to $200K!"
    - Team wins big → "They're unbeatable!"
    
    **Fix:** Consider full history, not just recent data. Zoom out.

## Implied Odds Example

**Market:** "Will it rain tomorrow?"

**Weather forecast:** 60% chance of rain

**Market prices:**
- YES (rain): $0.70
- NO (no rain): $0.30

**Analysis:**
- Market implies 70% chance of rain
- Weather forecast says 60%
- **Market is overvaluing rain by 10%**

**Action:** Buy NO at $0.30

**Expected value:**
- If correct (40% chance): Win $0.70/share
- If wrong (60% chance): Lose $0.30/share
- EV = (0.40 × $0.70) - (0.60 × $0.30) = $0.28 - $0.18 = **+$0.10/share**

## Kelly Criterion for Position Sizing

**Optimal bet sizing formula:**

$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

Where:
- $f^*$ = Fraction of bankroll to bet
- $b$ = Odds received (net return)
- $p$ = Win probability
- $q$ = Lose probability

**Example:**
- Buy YES at $0.60 (potential return: $0.40 per $0.60 bet = 0.667 odds)
- You estimate 70% win probability
- Kelly = $(0.667 \times 0.70 - 0.30) / 0.667 = 0.316$
- **Bet 31.6% of bankroll** (full Kelly)

<Info>
**Half-Kelly:** Most professionals use half-Kelly (15.8% in example) to reduce volatility.
