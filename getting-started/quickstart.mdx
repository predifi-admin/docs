## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long until I can claim winnings?" icon="clock">
    Markets have a settlement period (1-3 days typically) after the event concludes. This allows for verification and any disputes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sell my position before the market resolves?" icon="door-open">
    Yes! You can sell at any time at the current market price. This locks in profits or cuts losses early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I lose?" icon="circle-xmark">
    Your shares expire worthless. The USDC you spent on them is lost. Only winning shares pay out $1.00 each.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trade on multiple chains?" icon="link">
    Yes! Predifi supports multiple EVM chains. Your wallet can hold positions across different chains, all visible in one portfolio.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need different tokens for gas on each chain?" icon="gas-pump">
    For direct trades, yes. But Predifi's Smart AA Wallet can handle gas abstraction, letting you pay gas in USDC.
  </Accordion>
