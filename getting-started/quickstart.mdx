  - At least $20 USDC for your first trade
</Note>

---

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Predifi">
    Go to [app.predifi.com](https://app.predifi.com)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Connect Wallet'">
    Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Your Wallet">
    Select your wallet provider:
    - **MetaMask** - Most popular browser extension wallet
    - **WalletConnect** - Connect mobile wallets
    - **Coinbase Wallet** - Coinbase's self-custody wallet
    - **Other** - Any EVM-compatible wallet
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve Connection">
    Approve the connection request in your wallet. This doesn't cost anything or give Predifi access to your funds.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Switch Network (if needed)">
    Your wallet may prompt you to switch to the correct network. Approve this request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Don't have a wallet?** Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) (browser extension) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) (mobile app). Both are free and take 2 minutes to set up.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

You need **USDC (USD Coin)** to trade on Predifi.

### Option A: Buy USDC Directly

If your wallet supports it (Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask in some regions):
1. Click "Buy" or "Add Funds" in your wallet
2. Choose USDC
3. Complete the purchase with card/bank
4. USDC appears in your wallet

### Option B: Bridge from Another Chain

If you have USDC on a different chain:
1. Use a bridge like [Stargate](https://stargate.finance) or [Across](https://across.to)
2. Bridge USDC to your current chain
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for bridge completion

### Option C: Swap from Other Tokens

If you have ETH or other tokens:
1. Use a DEX like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)
2. Swap to USDC on your current chain
3. Keep some ETH for gas fees

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always keep some native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) in your wallet for gas fees. We recommend at least $5 worth.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Place Your Trade

Let's walk through placing a trade:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Position">
    Choose **YES** or **NO**:
    - Click YES if you think the event will happen
    - Click NO if you think it won't happen
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Enter how much USDC you want to trade. Start with $20-50 for your first trade.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Trade Details">
    Before confirming, review:
    - **Price**: Cost per share
    - **Shares**: Number of shares you'll receive
    - **Total Cost**: Amount debited from your wallet
    - **Potential Payout**: $1.00 per share if you win
    - **Fees**: Protocol fee (shown clearly)
    - **Est. Profit**: Your profit if you win
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Product (if available)">
    For some markets, you can choose:
    - **Aggregator**: Trade on external venues (best for popular markets)
    - **Native CLOB**: Trade on Predifi's orderbook (best for advanced traders)
    
    If unsure, choose Aggregator.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Trade">
    Click "Place Trade" or "Buy YES" / "Buy NO"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve in Wallet">
    Your wallet will pop up asking you to:
    1. **Approve USDC** (first time only) - Let Predifi access your USDC
    2. **Confirm Trade** - Execute the trade
    
    Click "Approve" or "Confirm" for each transaction.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Execution">
    - **Native CLOB**: Executes in seconds
    - **Aggregator**: May take 5-10 minutes for cross-chain execution
    
    You'll see a progress indicator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Trade Confirmation Example

```
Market: Will Bitcoin reach $100k in 2025?

## Step 5: Track Your Position

After your trade executes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View in Portfolio">
    Click "Portfolio" or "Positions" in the navigation menu
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    For each position, you'll see:
    - Market name and outcome
    - Shares held
    - Average entry price
    - Current market price
    - Unrealized P&L (profit/loss)
    - Days until resolution
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Position">
    You can:
    - **Sell Early**: Exit before resolution at current price
    - **Add More**: Increase your position if conviction grows
    - **Watch**: Wait for resolution
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Price movements**: Your position value changes as market prices fluctuate. Green = profit, Red = loss (unrealized until you sell or market resolves).
</Info>

## Step 6: Claim Your Winnings

When the market resolves in your favor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Resolved Markets">
    You'll receive a notification (if enabled). Check your Portfolio for resolved markets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Outcome">
    Confirm the market resolved correctly. The winning outcome will be displayed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Claim'">
    Click the "Claim Winnings" button next to your winning position
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Transaction">
    Approve the claim transaction in your wallet (small gas fee required)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive USDC">
    USDC is sent directly to your wallet. Check your balance!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payout Calculation

```
Your Position: 80 YES shares
Market Resolved: YES wins
Gross Payout: 80 × $1.00 = $80
Fee (Native CLOB only): 2% of $80 = $1.60
Net Payout: $78.40
(Aggregator has no claim fee - you already paid at trade time)
```

## Common Beginner Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much should I start with?">
    We recommend $50-100 to start. This lets you place several small trades to learn without significant risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lose more than I invest?">
    **No.** Your maximum loss is the amount you trade. You cannot lose more than you put in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I'm wrong about the outcome?">
    If the market resolves against you, your shares expire worthless. You lose your investment (minus any amount you might have recovered by selling early).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sell before the market resolves?">
    **Yes!** You can sell your position anytime at the current market price. This lets you lock in profits or cut losses early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are gas fees?">
    Gas fees are blockchain transaction costs paid to validators. They're typically $0.50-$2 per transaction on Layer 2 networks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did my trade take so long?">
    If using the Aggregator with cross-chain execution, bridging funds takes 5-10 minutes. Native CLOB trades execute in seconds.
