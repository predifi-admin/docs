## Understanding Prices & Odds

### Price = Probability

In prediction markets, the price reflects the market's estimated probability:

| Price | Probability | Implied Odds |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| $0.50 | 50% | 50/50 (Even) |
| $0.67 | 67% | 2:1 (Likely) |
| $0.80 | 80% | 4:1 (Very likely) |
| $0.33 | 33% | 1:2 (Unlikely) |
| $0.20 | 20% | 1:4 (Very unlikely) |

**Example:**
- Market: "BTC > $100K by Jan 15"
- Current price: $0.65 YES
- Interpretation: Market thinks there's a **65% chance** BTC will exceed $100K by Jan 15

## Calculating Profit & Loss

### If You Win

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Shares} \times \$1.00 - \text{Cost}
$$

**Example:**
- Buy 100 shares of YES at $0.60 = $60 cost
- Market resolves YES
- Payout: 100 × $1.00 = $100
- **Profit: $100 - $60 = $40** (67% return)

### If You Lose

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Cost}
$$

**Example:**
- Buy 100 shares of YES at $0.60 = $60 cost
- Market resolves NO
- Payout: $0
- **Loss: $60** (100% of investment)

## Trading Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Value Betting" icon="gem">
    **Find mispriced markets**
    
    1. Research true probability of event
    2. Compare to market price
    3. If market undervalues: Buy YES
    4. If market overvalues: Buy NO
    
    **Example:**
    - Your analysis: 70% chance BTC > $100K
    - Market price: $0.60 (60% implied)
    - **Action:** Buy YES (market underpricing by 10%)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Event Trading" icon="calendar">
    **Trade around news and events**
    
    - Buy before positive catalysts
    - Sell before negative catalysts
    - React quickly to breaking news
    - Exit before event conclusion
    
    **Example:** Buy BTC > $100K before Fed rate decision, sell after if favorable
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Scalping" icon="gauge-high">
    **Quick in-and-out trades**
    
    - Buy low, sell high (same market)
    - Profit from short-term price movements
    - High frequency, small profits
    - Requires active monitoring
    
    **Example:** Buy YES at $0.65, sell at $0.68 for 4.6% gain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Arbitrage" icon="scale-balanced">
    **Exploit price differences**
    
    - Same market, different venues
    - Buy low venue, sell high venue

    **Example:**
    - Polymarket: BTC > $100K at $0.62
    - Limitless: Same market at $0.67
    - Buy Polymarket, sell Limitless = $0.05/share profit
  </Accordion>

## Risk Management

**Never risk more than you can afford to lose.** Prediction markets involve real financial risk.
</Warning>

### Position Sizing

**Advanced:** Risk up to 15-20% on high-conviction trades

**Example with $1,000 bankroll:**
- Conservative: $20-50 per trade
- Moderate: $50-100 per trade
- Aggressive: $150-200 per trade
