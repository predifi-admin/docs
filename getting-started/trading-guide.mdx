## Understanding Prices & Odds

### Price = Probability

| Price | Probability | Implied Odds |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| $0.50 | 50% | Even |
| $0.67 | 67% | 2:1 (Likely) |
| $0.80 | 80% | 4:1 (Very likely) |
| $0.33 | 33% | 1:2 (Unlikely) |
| $0.20 | 20% | 1:4 (Very unlikely) |

**Example:** BTC > $100K at $0.65 YES = Market thinks **65% chance**

## Calculating Profit & Loss

### If You Win

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Shares} \times \$1.00 - \text{Cost}
$$

**Example:** Buy 100 shares YES at $0.60 = $60 cost | Market resolves YES | Payout: 100 × $1.00 = $100 | **Profit: $40 (67% return)**

### If You Lose

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Cost}
$$

**Example:** Buy 100 shares YES at $0.60 = $60 cost | Market resolves NO | Payout: $0 | **Loss: $60**
