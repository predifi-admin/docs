## Smart Account Abstraction

### What Happens When You Sign Up

Behind the scenes, Predifi creates a **Smart Account (AA Wallet)** for you powered by **Alchemy Account Kit**:

### Why Smart Accounts?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Gas Abstraction">
    **No gas tokens needed**
    
    Traditional crypto:
    ```
    ❌ Need ETH/MATIC/BNB for gas
    ❌ Different gas token per chain
    ❌ Run out of gas mid-transaction
    ❌ Complex for newcomers
    ```
    
    With Smart AA Wallet:
    ```
    ✅ Pay gas in USDC (or we sponsor it)
    ✅ Same experience on all chains
    ✅ Never worry about gas
    ✅ Simple for everyone
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Social Recovery">
    **Never lose access**
    
    Traditional wallet:
    ```
    ❌ Lose seed phrase = lose funds forever
    ❌ No backup option
    ❌ High stress
    ```
    
    Smart AA Wallet:
    ```
    ✅ Multiple recovery methods
    ✅ Guardian system (email, phone)
    ✅ Account recovery without seed phrase
    ✅ Peace of mind
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Batch Transactions">
    **One-click complex operations**
    
    Traditional:
    ```
    ❌ Approve USDC (tx 1)
    ❌ Wait for confirmation
    ❌ Deposit to vault (tx 2)
    ❌ Wait again
    ❌ Place trade (tx 3)
    → 3 transactions, 5 minutes
    ```
    
    Smart AA Wallet:
    ```
    ✅ All 3 actions in one transaction
    ✅ One confirmation
    ✅ 30 seconds total
    → Better UX
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Session Keys">
    **Trade without constant approvals**
    
    Traditional:
    ```
    ❌ Every trade needs wallet approval
    ❌ Pop-up for every action
    ❌ Interrupts flow
    ```
    
    Smart AA Wallet:
    ```
    ✅ Approve session once
    ✅ Trade freely for X hours
    ✅ No interruptions
    ✅ Like Web2 UX
    ```
  </Tab>
