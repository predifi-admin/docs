## When to Use Each Product

### Choose Aggregator When:

✅ **You want access to popular markets** - Trade on trending markets from Polymarket and Limitless  
✅ **You value simplicity** - Simple buy/sell interface, no complex order types  
✅ **You want maximum market choice** - Hundreds of active markets across all categories  
✅ **You prefer low trading fees** - Only 0.05-0.1% fee on trades  

### Choose Native CLOB When:

✅ **You want professional trading tools** - Full orderbook, limit orders, advanced analytics  
✅ **You need instant execution** - No cross-chain delays, trades execute immediately  
✅ **You're a frequent trader** - Pay fees only on winning trades, not every transaction  
✅ **You want better price control** - Set exact limit orders instead of market orders  

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: You can use both! Many traders use the Aggregator for access to specific markets while using Native CLOB for markets where they want tighter control.
