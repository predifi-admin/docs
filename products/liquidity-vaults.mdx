## What are Liquidity Vaults?

Predifi's **Liquidity Vaults** are ERC-4626 compliant smart contracts that let you earn yield by providing liquidity to prediction markets. Deposit USDC, receive vault shares, and automatically earn a portion of protocol fees.

> 💰 **Deposit USDC → Receive Vault Shares → Earn Fees Automatically → Withdraw Anytime**

## Returns & APY

### Fee Distribution

| Source | LP Share | Other |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **CLOB Fees** | 60% | 30% treasury, 10% insurance |
| **Aggregator Fees** | 60% | 30% treasury, 10% insurance |
| **Settlement Fees** | 60% | 30% treasury, 10% insurance |

### Historical APY (Estimated)

<Note>
  **Note**: These are projected estimates based on expected trading volumes. Actual returns will vary based on market activity.
</Note>

| Scenario | Monthly Volume | Est. APY |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Conservative | $1M | 5-8% |
| Moderate | $10M | 12-18% |
| Bullish | $50M | 25-35% |
| Very Bullish | $100M+ | 40-60% |

### Return Calculation Example

```
Vault TVL: $1,000,000
Monthly Volume: $10,000,000
Average Fee: 0.5%
Total Fees: $10M × 0.5% = $50,000
LP Share (60%): $50,000 × 60% = $30,000
Monthly Return: $30,000 / $1,000,000 = 3%
Annualized: 3% × 12 = 36% APY
```

<Warning>
  Past performance does not guarantee future results. Prediction market trading volumes can be volatile.
</Warning>

## How Vaults Generate Yield

### Delta Neutral Strategy

Liquidity Vaults earn yield through a **delta neutral market making strategy** combined with **protocol fee capture**:

```mermaid
graph TB

    subgraph "Yield Generation"

    REBALANCE --> VAULT

    style NEUTRAL fill:#10B981
    style FEES fill:#EC4899
```

### Three Revenue Streams

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Trading Fees">
    **Earn fees from protocol trading volume**
    
    LPs receive **60% of all trading fees** generated by the protocol:
    
    ```
    Example Daily Volume: $1,000,000
    Platform Trading Fees: 0.1% = $1,000
    LP Share (60%): $600/day
    
    With $1M in LP vault:
    Daily return: 0.06%
    Annualized: ~22% APY
    ```
    
    **Fee distribution is automatic**:
    - Fees collected from every trade
    - Distributed proportionally to vault shares
    - Increases share value in real-time
    - No manual claiming needed
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="2. Market Making Spread">
    **Capture bid-ask spread**
    
    Vault provides liquidity on both sides:
    
    ```
    Market: BTC to $100k?
    
    Vault provides:
    - BID: $0.64 (buy YES from users)
    - ASK: $0.66 (sell YES to users)
    - Spread: 2 cents per trade
    
    On $100k daily volume:
    Spread capture: $2,000/day
    With $1M vault: 0.2%/day = 73% APY
    ```
    
    **Delta neutral maintenance**:
    - Equal exposure to YES and NO
    - Net market exposure = $0
    - Profit from spread, not price movement
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="3. Rebalancing Profits">
    **Earn from position rebalancing**
    
    As markets move, vault rebalances:
    
    ```
    Scenario: YES price moves 0.60 → 0.70
    
    Vault rebalances:
    1. Sell some YES at $0.70 (high)
    2. Buy more NO at $0.30 (low)
    3. Maintain delta neutral
    4. Pocket the difference
    
    Profit per rebalance: 1-3% of position
    Multiple rebalances/day: 5-15% APY
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Delta Neutral Example

**Maintaining market neutrality:**

<Accordion title="Step-by-Step Delta Neutral Strategy" icon="scale-balanced">
  
**Initial State:**
```
Vault: $1,000,000 USDC
Market: BTC to $100k (YES @ $0.65, NO @ $0.35)

Vault Position:
- Buy 750,000 YES shares @ $0.65 = $487,500
- Buy 750,000 NO shares @ $0.35 = $262,500
- Total deployed: $750,000
- Reserve: $250,000
- Net exposure: $0 (perfectly hedged)
```

**Market Moves (BTC pumps, YES → $0.80):**
```
New prices: YES @ $0.80, NO @ $0.20

Vault value:
- YES shares: 750k × $0.80 = $600,000
- NO shares: 750k × $0.20 = $150,000
- Total: $750,000 (same as before!)
- Net exposure: Still $0
```

**Rebalancing for Profit:**
```
1. Sell 100k YES @ $0.80 = $80,000 profit locked
2. Buy 100k more NO @ $0.20 = $20,000 spent
3. Net profit: $60,000 from rebalancing
4. Return to balanced exposure
```

</Accordion>

## Withdrawal Process

### How Withdrawals Work

1. **Request Withdrawal** - Burn vault shares to redeem USDC
2. **Check Utilization** - System checks if sufficient idle liquidity exists
3. **Instant vs Queued**:
   - If liquidity available: Instant withdrawal
   - If high utilization: Added to withdrawal queue
4. **Queue Processing** - As positions close, queued withdrawals are processed FIFO
5. **Receive USDC** - USDC + yield sent to your wallet

### Utilization Levels

| Utilization | Withdrawal Experience |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 0-50% | Instant withdrawals |
| 50-80% | Possible slight delay |
| 80-95% | Likely queued |
| 95-100% | Definitely queued |

<Info>
  You can view current utilization rate in the vault dashboard before depositing or withdrawing.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deposit for the Long Term" icon="calendar">
    Vault strategies work best over months, not days. Plan to keep funds deposited for at least 3-6 months.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Utilization" icon="gauge">
    Check utilization before withdrawing. If it's high, you may want to wait for positions to close.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diversify" icon="chart-scatter">
    Don't put all your capital in vaults. Maintain diversification across different yield sources.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Understand Risks" icon="shield-exclamation">
    Read the risks section carefully. Vaults can lose value in adverse market conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Performance" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly review your vault performance. If returns don't meet expectations, consider reallocating.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is ERC-4626?" icon="circle-question">
    ERC-4626 is a standard interface for tokenized vaults. It makes vaults interoperable and easy to integrate with other DeFi protocols.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lose my deposit?" icon="exclamation">
    Yes. If markets move against LP positions significantly, vault value can decrease. However, over time, protocol fees should outweigh losses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often are yields distributed?" icon="clock">
    Continuously! Yield accrues to vault share value in real-time as fees are collected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw anytime?" icon="door-open">
    Mostly yes, but subject to utilization. If liquidity is fully deployed, you may need to wait for positions to close.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are vault shares transferable?" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Yes! Vault shares are ERC-20 tokens. You can transfer them to other addresses or trade them (if secondary markets exist).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the vault gets hacked?" icon="user-shield">
    Vaults include emergency pause mechanisms and insurance funds. However, smart contract risk always exists. Only deposit what you can afford to lose.
