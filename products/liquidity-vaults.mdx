## How Vaults Generate Yield

### Delta Neutral Strategy

Earn yield through **delta neutral market making** + **protocol fee capture**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Trading Fees">
    **60% of all trading fees**
    
    Example: $1M daily volume × 0.1% = $1,000 fees → $600/day to LPs
    With $1M in vault: 0.06%/day = ~22% APY
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="2. Market Making Spread">
    **Capture bid-ask spread**
    
    Provide liquidity on both sides:
    - BID: $0.64 | ASK: $0.66 = 2¢ spread
    - $100k volume = $2,000/day spread capture
    - With $1M vault: 0.2%/day = 73% APY
    
    **Delta neutral**: Equal YES/NO exposure = $0 net market risk
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="3. Rebalancing Profits">
    **Earn from position rebalancing**
    
    As markets move, vault rebalances:
    - Sell high, buy low
    - Maintain delta neutral
    - Pocket the difference
    - Profit: 1-3% per rebalance, 5-15% APY
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### APY Breakdown

| Component | Conservative | Expected | Optimistic |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Trading Fees (60% share)** | 15% | 25% | 40% |
| **Market Making Spread** | 5% | 10% | 20% |
| **Rebalancing Profits** | 3% | 5% | 10% |
| **Total APY** | **23%** | **40%** | **70%** |

<Info>
Returns variable based on trading volume, market volatility, utilization rates. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

## Risk Management

**How we minimize LP risk:**

- **Delta Neutral = No Market Risk**: Equal long/short exposure. Profit from volatility, not direction.
- **Diversification**: Liquidity spread across 100+ markets, multiple asset classes, varied time frames.
- **Utilization Limits**: Max 80% deployed, 20% reserve for withdrawals.
- **Smart Contract Safeguards**: Emergency pause, rate limiters, multi-sig admin, security audits in progress.

## Best Practices

- **Deposit Long Term**: Vault strategies work best over 3-6+ months, not days.
- **Monitor Utilization**: Check before withdrawing. High utilization may require waiting.
- **Diversify**: Don't put all capital in vaults. Maintain diversification.
- **Understand Risks**: Read risks section. Vaults can lose value in adverse conditions.
- **Track Performance**: Review regularly. Reallocate if returns don't meet expectations.
