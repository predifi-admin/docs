## What is Native CLOB?

The **Predifi Native CLOB** is Predifi's own prediction market platform powered by a professional **Central Limit Order Book**. Unlike simple AMM-based markets, CLOB provides the trading experience you'd expect from traditional financial exchanges.

> 📊 **Professional Orderbook → Instant Matching → Advanced Orders → Better Price Discovery**

## CLOB vs AMM

| Feature | CLOB (Predifi Native) | AMM (Most Prediction Markets) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Order Types** | Market & Limit orders | Market orders only |
| **Price Control** | Set exact price | Take current price |
| **Liquidity** | From other traders | From liquidity pool |
| **Slippage** | Minimal (orderbook depth) | Can be high on illiquid pools |
| **Price Discovery** | Efficient (many price levels) | Less efficient |
| **Transparency** | Full orderbook visibility | Pool reserves only |

<Note>
**Think of it this way**: AMM is like a vending machine (fixed prices). CLOB is like eBay (you can bid/ask at any price, trades happen when prices match).
</Note>

## How It Works

### Off-Chain Matching, On-Chain Settlement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Place Order (Off-Chain)">
    Submit signed order (EIP-712 signature). No gas fees to place orders.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order Matching (Off-Chain)">
    Matching engine finds counterparties and matches orders instantly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement (On-Chain)">
    Matched trades settle on-chain in batches for gas efficiency.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Position Tokens (On-Chain)">
    You receive ERC1155 position tokens (YES or NO shares).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Market Resolution (On-Chain)">
    Oracle resolves market. Winners claim $1.00 per share.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Design?

- ✅ **Gas efficient** - Only settlement and claims cost gas
- ✅ **Instant matching** - No waiting for blocks
- ✅ **Better UX** - Place and cancel orders for free
- ✅ **Verifiable** - Cryptographic signatures prevent manipulation
- ✅ **Trustless** - Smart contracts enforce settlement

## Key Features

### 📊 Full Orderbook Depth

See complete market depth at every price level:

```
BIDS (Buy YES)          |  ASKS (Sell YES)
$0.67  |  2,500 shares  |  $0.68  |  1,800 shares
$0.66  |  5,000 shares  |  $0.69  |  3,200 shares
$0.65  |  8,500 shares  |  $0.70  |  6,000 shares
```

This transparency lets you:
- Assess real liquidity
- See where large orders sit
- Plan better entry/exit points
- Identify support/resistance levels

### 🎯 Limit Orders

**Set your price and wait for the market to come to you:**

**Example Buy Limit Order**:
- Current price: $0.70
- Set limit buy at $0.65
- Order executes IF price touches $0.65
- Saves money vs buying at $0.70

<Tip>
Limit orders are perfect for traders who have a target price and patience. You often get better execution than market orders.
</Tip>

### ⚡ Instant Execution

- **Off-chain matching** = no blockchain confirmation delays
- Orders execute in **milliseconds**
- Position updates appear immediately
- No waiting for block times

### 📈 Advanced Charts & Analytics

Professional trading tools:
- Real-time price charts (TradingView style)
- Volume analysis

## Order Types

### Market Orders

**Execute immediately at best available price**

**Example:**
```
Current best ask: $0.68
Your market buy: 1,000 shares
You'll pay: $680 (plus 2% fee on winnings later)
Execution: Instant
```

### Limit Orders

**Set your price and wait for a match**

**Example:**
```
Current best ask: $0.70
Your limit buy: 1,000 shares @ $0.65
Status: Open (waiting for price to drop)
If market drops to $0.65: Auto-executes
If doesn't reach $0.65: Order stays open until you cancel
```

### Partial Fills

Orders can be filled in parts:

```
Your order: Buy 5,000 shares @ $0.66
Available at $0.66: 2,000 shares

Result:
- 2,000 shares filled immediately @ $0.66
- 3,000 shares remain open as limit order
- You can cancel remaining 3,000 anytime
```

## Fee Structure

### Pay Only When You Win

Unlike most platforms that charge fees on every trade, Predifi Native CLOB charges **only when you claim winning positions**.

| Action | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Place order** | FREE (off-chain signature) |
| **Cancel order** | FREE |
| **Trade execution** | Gas fee only (~$0.50) |
| **Claim winnings** | **2% of profit** (5% max) |
| **Losing trades** | $0 (no fee) |

### Fee Example

**Realistic Example**:

```
Buy 1,000 YES shares @ $0.60 = $600 invested
Market resolves YES
Gross payout: 1,000 × $1.00 = $1,000
Protocol fee: 2% of $1,000 = $20
Net payout: $980
Your profit: $980 - $600 = $380 profit (63% return)
```

<Tip>
The "pay on winnings" model aligns incentives. Predifi only makes money when you make money!
