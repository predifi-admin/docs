## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compare Before Trading" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Check execution venue and price. Same market may be cheaper on one platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Bridge Costs" icon="bridge">
    For small trades (under $100), bridge fees eat into profits. Consider Native CLOB for smaller amounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Slippage" icon="gauge-high">
    On illiquid markets, your trade size might move price. Set appropriate slippage tolerance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Cross-Chain Positions" icon="list-check">
    Remember positions exist on different chains. Factor this into wallet management.
