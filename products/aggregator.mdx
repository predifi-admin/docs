## What is the Aggregator?

The **Predifi Aggregator** brings together prediction markets from multiple platforms into one unified interface. Instead of creating accounts on Polymarket, Limitless, and other venues, trade on all of them through Predifi.

<Note>
**One Interface → Multiple Venues → Best Prices → Unified Portfolio**
</Note>

## How It Works

### The Challenge

Traditional prediction markets are **fragmented**:
- Different platforms require different accounts
- Liquidity is split across venues
- You need to manually compare prices
- Managing positions across platforms is painful
- Each venue uses different blockchain networks

### The Predifi Solution

The Aggregator solves these problems by:

1. **Connecting to Multiple Venues** - Direct integration with Polymarket, Limitless, and more
2. **Pooling Liquidity** - Access combined liquidity from all connected venues
3. **Smart Routing** - Automatically route trades to the venue with the best price
4. **Cross-Chain Bridging** - Handle blockchain complexity behind the scenes
5. **Unified Portfolio** - Track all positions in one place

## Trading on the Aggregator

### Market Orders

The simplest way to trade:

1. Select a market
2. Choose YES or NO
3. Enter amount in USDC
4. See estimated price and fee
5. Confirm trade

Your order executes immediately at the best available price across all venues.

### Price Comparison

Before executing, Predifi shows you:

- **Best available price** across all venues
- **Estimated cost** including fees
- **Expected shares** you'll receive
- **Execution venue** where order will be routed
- **Estimated time** for cross-chain execution

### Slippage Protection

Set a **maximum slippage tolerance** to protect against price movements:

- Default: 1%
- Adjustable from 0.1% to 5%
- Trade reverts if price moves beyond tolerance

## Cross-Chain Execution

### How Bridging Works

When you trade on a venue that's on a different blockchain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Trade">
    You confirm the trade on Predifi
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bridge Funds">
    Predifi bridges your USDC to the venue's blockchain using Circle CCTP
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute on Venue">
    Trade executes on the destination venue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Position Tracking">
    Position appears in your Predifi portfolio
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement">
    When market resolves, winnings can be claimed back to your preferred chain
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Timing

- **Bridge time**: 2-5 minutes (depends on chain congestion)
- **Total execution**: Usually under 10 minutes
- **Real-time status**: Track progress in your transaction history

### Costs

- **Bridging fee**: ~$1-3 in gas costs
- **Protocol fee**: 0.05% - 0.1% of trade amount
- **No hidden fees**: All costs shown upfront

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compare Before Trading" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Check the execution venue and price. Sometimes the same market is cheaper on one platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Bridge Costs" icon="bridge">
    For small trades (under $100), bridge fees eat into profits. Consider batching trades or using Native CLOB for smaller amounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Slippage" icon="gauge-high">
    On illiquid markets, your trade size might move the price. Set appropriate slippage tolerance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Cross-Chain Positions" icon="list-check">
    Remember your positions exist on different chains. Factor this into your wallet management strategy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan Your Exits" icon="door-open">
    Selling early also incurs bridge costs if you need to move back to your home chain. Plan accordingly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity Information

Every market shows real-time liquidity data:

- **Available liquidity** at current price
- **24-hour volume** across all venues
- **Orderbook depth** (for markets with orderbooks)
- **Last trade price** and time
- **Total TVL** in the market

Use this information to assess if your desired trade size is feasible without excessive slippage.
