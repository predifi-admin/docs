## Non-Custodial Architecture

<Info>
**You always control your funds.** Predifi never has custody of your assets. All funds remain in your wallet or in audited smart contracts.
</Info>

- **Your keys, your crypto** - We never access your private keys
- **Smart contract escrow** - Funds locked in audited contracts only
- **No centralized custody** - Cannot freeze or seize your assets
- **Wallet-based authentication** - No password databases to hack

---

## Oracle Security

**Market resolution via decentralized oracles:**

- **Stork Network** - Decentralized oracle network with multiple data publishers
- **Challenge periods** - 24-48 hour windows to dispute incorrect resolutions
- **Multiple sources** - Cross-reference data from various providers
- **On-chain verification** - All oracle data verifiable on blockchain

## Emergency Procedures

### Circuit Breakers

Automated protections pause trading during anomalies:

- **Price manipulation detected** - Trading paused for investigation
- **Oracle failure** - Markets frozen until resolution
- **Smart contract exploit** - Immediate pause functionality
- **Unusual volume spikes** - Temporary trading halt for review

### Emergency Withdrawals

If Predifi platform goes offline:

1. **Direct contract interaction** - Withdraw via blockchain explorer (Etherscan)
2. **Open source frontends** - Community can host alternative UIs
3. **Decentralized settlement** - Markets resolve via oracles regardless of platform status
