## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Predifi?" icon="circle-question">
    Predifi is a prediction market trading platform that lets you trade on real-world events. We aggregate markets from multiple venues (Polymarket, Limitless) and operate our own native prediction market with a professional orderbook.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are prediction markets?" icon="chart-line">
    Prediction markets let you trade on the outcomes of future events. You buy YES or NO shares that pay $1.00 if your prediction is correct. Prices reflect the market's collective belief about probability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Predifi legal?" icon="scale-balanced">
    Predifi operates as a decentralized protocol on public blockchains. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws. We recommend consulting with legal counsel in your jurisdiction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to create an account?" icon="user">
    No! Predifi is non-custodial. Just connect your wallet and start trading. No email, password, or KYC required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What blockchains does Predifi support?" icon="link">
    Predifi is chain-agnostic and can be deployed on any EVM-compatible blockchain. We're currently live on Layer 2 networks for fast, cheap transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Predifi audited?" icon="shield-check">

## Account & Wallet

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported?" icon="wallet">
    Any EVM-compatible wallet works:
    - MetaMask (browser extension & mobile)
    - Coinbase Wallet
    - WalletConnect (connects 100+ wallets)
    - Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and more
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple wallets?" icon="users">
    Yes! You can connect different wallets, and each will have its own separate positions and balance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I lose access to my wallet?" icon="key">
    Predifi cannot recover lost wallets. ALWAYS back up your seed phrase securely. We recommend:
    - Writing it down on paper (not digital)
    - Storing in a safe location
    - Never sharing with anyone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Predifi hold my funds?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    No! Predifi is non-custodial. You trade directly from your wallet. We never have access to your private keys or funds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple accounts?" icon="clone">
    You can use multiple wallets, but each wallet is considered a separate "account" from a portfolio tracking perspective.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trading & Orders

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the minimum trade size?" icon="gauge-min">
    Minimum trade: $10 USDC. No maximum (subject to available liquidity).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel an order?" icon="xmark">
    - **Native CLOB limit orders**: Yes, free to cancel anytime before execution
    - **Market orders**: No, they execute immediately
    - **Aggregator orders**: No, they route immediately
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's slippage?" icon="arrow-down-up-across-line">
    Slippage is when the price you get differs from the price you expected. It happens on large orders in illiquid markets. Set slippage tolerance to protect yourself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sell my position before the market resolves?" icon="door-open">
    Yes! You can sell (exit) your position anytime at the current market price. This lets you lock in profits or cut losses without waiting for resolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a market is canceled?" icon="ban">
    All positions are refunded at cost with no fees charged. This is rare and only happens if the market becomes unresolvable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trade on my phone?" icon="mobile">
    Yes! Predifi's web app works on mobile browsers. Connect with WalletConnect or mobile wallet browsers. Native mobile apps are planned for the future.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did my trade take so long?" icon="clock">
    - **Native CLOB**: Executes in seconds
    - **Aggregator cross-chain**: Takes 5-10 minutes for bridging
    - Network congestion can slow transactions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fees & Costs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What fees does Predifi charge?" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Aggregator**: 0.05-0.1% on trade amount  
    **Native CLOB**: 2% on winnings only  
    **Bridge fees**: $1-3 for cross-chain trades  
    **Gas fees**: ~$0.50-$2 per transaction
    
    [View complete fee breakdown →](/traders/fees-and-pricing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there deposit or withdrawal fees?" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    No! Depositing to your wallet and withdrawing from Predifi are both free (only standard gas fees apply).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are there gas fees?" icon="gas-pump">
    Gas fees pay blockchain validators to process transactions. These go to the network, not Predifi. Layer 2 networks keep gas under $2 per transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pay fees in ETH or other tokens?" icon="coins">
    Currently, you need USDC for trading and some native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) for gas. Multi-token support is under consideration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I pay fees on losing trades?" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Aggregator**: Yes, 0.1% fee is charged at trade time regardless of outcome  
    **Native CLOB**: No! Only winners pay the 2% fee on claims
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Winnings & Payouts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I claim my winnings?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    1. Go to your Portfolio
    2. Find resolved markets where you won
    3. Click "Claim Winnings"
    4. Approve the transaction in your wallet
    5. USDC is sent directly to your wallet
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to receive payouts?" icon="stopwatch">
    Once you submit a claim transaction, payout is instant (1 block confirmation, ~2 seconds on most L2s).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can winnings be auto-claimed?" icon="robot">
    Not currently. You must manually claim winning positions. Auto-claim features are under consideration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't claim my winnings?" icon="hourglass">
    There's no time limit. Winnings stay claimable indefinitely. However, we recommend claiming within a reasonable time to avoid losing track.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are winnings taxable?" icon="receipt">
    Likely yes in most jurisdictions, but tax laws vary by country. Consult a tax professional. Predifi does not provide tax advice or issue tax forms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Market Resolution

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who decides market outcomes?" icon="gavel">
    **Native CLOB**: Resolved by Stork Network oracles using verifiable real-world data  
    **Aggregator**: Resolved by the source venue (Polymarket, Limitless, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the resolution is wrong?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Most markets have a dispute period allowing challenges. If disputed, additional validators review the outcome. In rare cases, markets may be voided and refunded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long after an event does a market resolve?" icon="calendar-check">
    Typically 1-48 hours after the outcome is known and confirmed by reliable sources. Complex events may take longer for verification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the event is canceled or postponed?" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Depends on the market's resolution rules (stated in the market description). Usually:
    - Postponed: Market end date extends
    - Canceled: Market may resolve as "No" or be voided/refunded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Predifi manipulate market outcomes?" icon="hand-point-up">
    No! Resolutions are determined by decentralized oracles (Stork Network) or external venues. Predifi has no control over outcomes.
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's USDC?" icon="circle-dollar">
    USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. It's the primary currency for trading on Predifi. 1 USDC = $1.00 (always).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a Layer 2 blockchain?" icon="layer-group">
    Layer 2s are blockchains built on top of Ethereum that offer faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security. Examples: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are ERC1155 tokens?" icon="ticket">
    ERC1155 is a token standard that allows multiple token types in one contract. Predifi uses ERC1155 for position tokens (YES/NO shares).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's EIP-712?" icon="signature">
    EIP-712 is a standard for typed structured data signing. It lets you sign orders off-chain securely without paying gas for each order placement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I need to 'approve' tokens?" icon="check-double">
    Token approval lets Predifi's smart contracts access your USDC to execute trades. This is a one-time action per token. It doesn't give Predifi control—only permission to execute approved trades.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's Circle CCTP?" icon="circle">
    Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol is a secure bridging mechanism for USDC between blockchains. It burns USDC on the source chain and mints it on the destination chain.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My transaction failed. What do I do?" icon="exclamation">
    Common causes:
    - Insufficient gas in wallet (need ETH/MATIC/etc.)

    - Insufficient USDC balance
    
    Check the error message in your wallet for specifics.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't see my position after trading" icon="magnifying-glass">

    - For cross-chain trades, wait 5-10 minutes for bridging
    - Refresh your Portfolio page
    - Verify you're connected with the correct wallet
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prices seem wrong or frozen" icon="gauge-circle-bolt">
    - Refresh the page to get latest data
    - Check network status (may be temporary API issue)
